	<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>I am, in the first place, one of the few
journalists to specialize on Motion Pictures.
This enables me to concentrate on
one subject instead of running the risk
of making a regular hash of everything
under the sun. I would not, naturally,
have chosen to follow this path were not
the theme the very versatile one it is.
So you can imagine that I am always on
the alert for new-idea germs for articles.</p>

<p>While searching for these I ran up
against the advertising field. I was well
aware that the motion picture had broken
into the publicity game with success, but
a good deal of investigating convinced
me that the reason this new publicity
medium had failed to gain a wide following
was because there was so little definite
information about it obtainable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Page 8]</span></p>

<p>No advertiser, I fully knew, would
consider a pig in the poke proposition, so
it occurred to me that here was my
chance to remedy the defect. What information
there was to be had on the
subject was scattered between the pages
of various business publications in occasional
articles, which fact set me to work
to write a concise handbook, embodying
everything worth knowing about Motion
Picture Advertising.</p>

<p>It will probably seem rather strange
to you that an invention like the cinematograph,
which has achieved widespread
fame as a form of entertainment, can
perform the functions of advertising, but
it is none the less a fact. Wonders have
not yet ceased in this every-day world,
believe me.</p>

<p>It also is not, I am glad to say, a
medium confined to any one business or
profession. It is, in fact, equally adaptable
to the large manufacturer as it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Page 9]</span>
to the smallest dealer in any trade.</p>

<p>Some advertisers may view a new
form of publicity in the light that it
necessitates a greater outlay without accomplishing
more than the old established
ad mediums. This, however, is not true
of the motion picture, for it possesses
business-pulling properties distinctly its
own. The extra expense is more than
recovered by the increased trade it develops.</p>

<p>It is, furthermore, an advertising
medium no modern business man can afford
to gloss over, so this little book is
entitled to his most careful consideration.</p>

		<small>TELLING YOUR ADVERTISING STORY BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>In spite of the versatility of the intrepid
motion picture as an advertising
medium, it has its limitations. This,
after all, is but natural, for all forms of
publicity are supposed to be links in the
chain, and not one is strong enough to
take the place of the whole.</p>

<p>It is clearly obvious, of course, that
when adopting motion-picture advertising,
everything has to be visualized by means
of animated photographs, so, therefore,
the appeal is presented through the eye.
As for the printed work, this takes a
back seat.</p>

<p>Since everything is intended to be absorbed
by the eye, a whole mass of explanatory
matter tagged on to the film<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</span>
would rather hinder the ad. instead of
adding further enlightenment as intended.
And the short time a sentence remains on
the screen does not allow lengthy statements
to sink in. Subtitles are weak devices
to help a photoplay story over stumbling-blocks,
and the less and shorter they
are, the better the picture will be. There
are plenty of other mediums in which
to display how well you can weave words,
so why drag them into a place where
they do not fit?</p>

<p>Besides, it is what the spectator sees,
not reads, that leaves the lasting impression,
which is the paramount point to
be reached in advertising by motion pictures.</p>

<p>And there is another important matter
to be weighed and considered. If you
overload your film with titles, you will befog
a good number of foreigners who
have not been long enough in our country
to master the English language, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</span>
their probable patronage is lost just because
the international language of the
film has been abused.</p>

<p>There has already arisen a select few
writers who have made a specialty of
combining advertising with motion pictures
and laying out campaigns for their
clients to the best possible advantage.</p>

<p>Motion-picture advertising, as a direct-appeal
proposition, is ineffective. You
may, for instance, have to get out a catalogue
in order to list the goods you make,
and you may also plan to get this over on
the screen by filming each article as you
would if you had a still photograph taken
and precede each with an insert, giving
prices and other particulars of same.
Apart from the fact that the film would
be voted deadly dull by audiences, it
would also fall flat as a business bringer.
You simply can’t do without advertising
literature, for the motion picture ends at
getting interested, and the old stand-bys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</span>
must clinch the deal at the right time.</p>

<p>Where the film excels is that your ad.
comes on the screen without competing
with any others for attention, and although
the spectator may not respond
easily to press advertising, he feels he has
to view the picture because he can not
“turn over a page,” or, in other words,
there is nothing else interesting for him to
turn his attention to. He will, if approached,
admit that the motion picture is
the most entertaining publicity channel
yet. You also reach him at his leisure,
and, therefore, approach him in the right
mood.</p>

<p>Get it out of your head right now that
anything in the nature of an ad. film will
produce the results you strive for; believe
me, the movie fan (there are twenty
million of them in this country) is a
most fastidious individual, for which
the improvements reached in photoplays
may be held responsible. You would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</span>
not expect a formal business notice to
do any good nowadays, would you?
Then, the same holds good of film advertising.</p>

<p>You can’t merely state on a film that
Bondin, the famous actor, derives great
enjoyment out of your preparation—it’s
too crude. But you can film an interview
with your worthy customer and introduce
some home-life scenes, not to forget his
testimonial of your goods visualized. This
would produce an exquisite blend of
entertainment and advertising.</p>

<p>All in all, it is action by which you have
to tell your story. You have, as a matter
of fact, to regard your proposition from
the angle of the man from Missouri. You
can take the public behind the scenes of
your works and convince them that the
goods are produced under the best of conditions.
The picture is likewise given an
educational touch because an industry is
being unfolded at the same time. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Page 16]</span>
if you want to bring out the important
selling points, you engage a writer to incorporate
them into a comedy or dramatic
photoplay. And so I could go on giving
examples of introducing life into the ad.
story. Action is the life and soul of the
film industry.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, too, that it is the quality
that tells, not quantity. I have seen efforts
along these lines that contained
material for a half-reel subject, yet they
were unduly extended to two reels, boring
an audience for forty minutes instead of
entertaining them for ten minutes. Picture-goers
are quick to resent padding,
and your film may defeat its purpose. A
good way to detect this beforehand is to
arrange for its projection and try to place
yourself in the position of the average
movie fan.</p>

<p>This padding is often done by the
smaller fry so as to make as much as
possible over the deal. But if the advertiser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Page 17]</span>
places himself in the hands of
a reliable industrial film concern, he
may rest assured of them not taking
undue advantage by charging for a lot

		<small>MOVIE ADVERTISING FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF A FAN</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>You may hardly credit it when I assert
that motion-picture audiences are the
most critical in the world. They do not
outwardly show their disapproval of
things, but after they resolved that the
photoplay was here to stay, anything as
a motion picture would no longer satisfy
them. So the film producers had to
humor the folks who had made their
wealth, and to-day the fans have been
educated up to such a pitch that nothing
but the best will satisfy them. Here,
then, is the class of readers represented
by moving-picture publicity.</p>

<p>The obvious conclusion is that advertisers
will have to follow in the path of
the ordinary producer in order to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Page 19]</span>
the greatest value out of this new advertising
medium.</p>

<p>A talk with an intelligent motion-picture
fan, as I found, is very interesting.
“I would like your views on ad. films,” I
asked.</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” she replied, and
forthwith got down to business.</p>

<p>“I must say that they are considerably
more interesting than the advertisements
that meet your eye in the newspapers.
How nice it is to watch an industry on
the screen and be taken through a big
manufacturing plant. It is an education
in itself, and it never strikes you as
though it was intended as a boost, although
the particular thing—the point
the advertiser wishes to bring home, I
believe you call it—leaves an indelible
impression on you.</p>

<p>“I also enjoy the films in which there
is a story. One such film, I remember,
told of a poor family who took in washing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Page 20]</span>
Disease abounded, and the folks
who had their laundry done learned their
lesson. Then the sanitary methods of
the steam laundry were contrasted. It
impressed me very much.</p>

<p>“The comic films are frequently
laughable, but I remember being offended
once at seeing a man like somebody’s beer
so much that he drank it until he was
dead drunk. I noticed that I was not the
only spectator to leave the hall. I like,
at all times, my photoplay fare to be in
good taste.</p>

<p>“At some of the movie theaters I attend
they make a practice of running a
number of slides after the reels. They
relate to neighboring stores, but are so
dry and shown for so many weeks without
being changed that I always skip
them.”</p>

<p>“Would you prefer,” I chimed in,
“that the advertising film portion be
abolished?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Page 21]</span></p>

<p>“I would not so long as the ordinary
pictures did not suffer in quality and
quantity. A show I regularly visit out
in New Jersey always runs the ad. films
after the program has finished. As the
pictures are invariably good ones, I always
stay to see them through, and most
others in the audience seem to do likewise.
And another thing, the subjects
are frequently changed, for naturally
one grows tired of seeing the same things
over and over again.”</p>

<p>“Have you,” I broached, “any suggestions
for improvements?”</p>

<p>“Sure; I would like to see some of
my favorite photoplayers take the leading
parts in the ad. stories. It would be
just crazy to watch Mary Fuller and
Francis X. Bushman as a pair of newly
weds who try to overcome housekeeping
difficulties with various modern articles
to be bought at stores.</p>

<p>“I also think that there is considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Page 22]</span>
room for improving the film plots.
They should be as good as the ordinary
photoplays. What they seem to lack is
strength. There is seldom any of the
strong, exciting situations which I am
accustomed to see, and the punch is often
conspicuous by its absence at the end.”</p>

		III.<br>
		<small>THE DOLLARS AND CENTS OF ADVERTISING BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>So far as I am aware, the cost aspects
of advertising by motion pictures
have not been dealt with in print before.
This may explain why so many advertisers,
national or otherwise, have neglected
to avail themselves of the many
opportunities offered by the new publicity
medium. As in all things, the cost
is the deciding point, and although the
average advertiser will not quibble over
a few dollars where there is the prospect
of increased business, he, nevertheless,
likes to know beforehand just what the
campaign is going to cost.</p>

<p>Every business man thinks of the
facts before anything else, and this chapter
is intended to furnish them so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Page 24]</span>
he need grope in the dark no longer.</p>

<p>I will suppose you follow the vade
mecum of most advertisers and arrange
to have a single-reel motion picture produced
showing conditions at your plant.
Even though it is only an industrial subject,
it calls for much careful thinking
and painstaking effort. A scenario will
have to be prepared, and in this the various
details you wish emphasized are
introduced in logical order. You can, of
course, withhold the trade secrets that
are not desirable for the public to see.
There is also a knack in inserting and
wording the subtitles, for one is frequently
employed to explain the obvious.
This results in film wastage, while all the
difficult points should be explained as
explicitly as possible, as each word used
consumes one foot of film.</p>

<p>A very bad habit which readily becomes
apparent and detracts the attention
of spectators from the object of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Page 25]</span>
film is the employees at the plant staring
hard at the camera while working. This
defect has marred a good many industrials,
and it gives the impression that
the workers are aware of what is happening,
whereas everything should appear
perfectly natural.</p>

<p>The movie camera man next films the
picture according to the scenario, allowing,
however, a certain amount of feet
for each incident, which depends on the
importance of same. Providing sufficient
daylight is available, the usual inclusive
fee charged for the producing and developing
of such a film is fifty cents per
foot—or $500 for the entire reel, which
is exactly a thousand feet. This is only
for the negative, ten cents per foot being
charged for each positive copy. You will,
naturally, require more than one print,
so you can figure on a cost of $100 for
each copy. I will come back to this point
later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Page 26]</span></p>

<p>Maybe in parts of your manufacturing
plant daylight is at a premium, in
which event you will be obliged to pay
fifty cents more per foot for the negative
copy for installing the necessary
artificial lighting. These charges include
an allowance for padding, which is
promptly eliminated, thus improving the
whole picture.</p>

<p>One does not have to seek far why
the comedy and dramatic photoplay is
not popular with most motion-picture
advertisers down to date. Yet, if they
only knew the truth, they would find
that movie audiences enjoy an entertaining
story better than an advertisement
contained in a film which merely strives
to educate. The former, as one might
expect, is more involved and expensive.
In the first place, a good story is essential,
and this may only be expected from
an experienced photoplaywright who has
an appreciation of advertising values.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Page 27]</span>
Personally speaking, I have received as
much as $100 for conceiving and putting
a one-reel photoplay in scenario form.
Then you will need a capable cast of
actors and a talented director to produce
the picture in order to give it a distinctly
expert professional touch. Probably interior
scenes are called for outside of
your works. These have to be erected
in the studio at an additional expense.</p>

<p>The cost, of course, depends on the
nature of the play, but all these things
should be provided from $1.25 to $3 per
foot. This works out at a cost of from
$1,250 to $3,000 for producing the negative.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that, once the
film has been produced, it is always available,
the only extra charge being for
extra positive copies you may require to
replace the ones in use when worn out.
If you want to save expense in the matter,
and do not object to delay in operating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Page 28]</span>
your campaign, you can arrange for
a given number of your dealers over a
certain territory to retain the film for a
day, then loan it to the local motion-picture
theater for its evening show. If,
however, you want to cover all the territory
at one time, then you will need more
prints in circulation.</p>

<p>Do not permit a print to be constantly
in use for more than six months without
replacing it with a new copy, for you
have to make a due allowance for wear
and tear. It would not do to let your
film graduate to the “rainy” stage,
since your pictorial advertisement, to
leave a good impression on movie audiences,
must be in perfect condition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no general advertising
circulation plan has been put in execution,
but it is best either to have the producing
concern help you out, or else rely upon
your dealers to aid you in their respective
localities. Being on the spot and knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Page 29]</span>
the co-operation is to the advantage
of all concerned, he can, no doubt, arrange
matters with the best local exhibitor.
The fee for showing is merely a
matter of arrangement, but in many cases
you will incur no expense.</p>

		<small>SOME FILM ADVERTISING METHODS FOR THE MANUFACTURER</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Boosting Trademarks</span></p>

<p>I will first endeavor to show the proprietor
of an advertised article the best
uses to which the motion picture can be
put, for some “copy” screens better than
others, and the advertiser should use discrimination.</p>

<p>Now, one of the greatest assets a
manufacturer can have is a trademark.
This he uses as fuel when trying to point
out to the public, by means of press announcements,
posters and literature, not
to accept substitutes. Be the trademark
a good one for pictorial purposes, and a
specialist is called in to give the branded
article a lasting impression on the public
desired to reach, and the results will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Page 31]</span>
please. I am a photoplay writer who
specializes in writing such plays to order,
so I know what I am talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Making Catch Phrases More
Popular</span></p>

<p>Catch phrases are also good plot
germs, and are capable of being worked
in the same manner as trademarks.</p>

<p>Not a few of our leading manufacturers
have familiar persons in connection
with their standard articles. The
other year Messrs. Siemen Brothers, an
English firm, brought their well-known
“Wotan” maid and “Tantalum” man to
life in a film. It was a comedy, and the
plot’s mission, besides introducing these
figures, was to bring home how 75 per
cent. of the electric-light bill could be
saved by the “Wotan” and “Tantalum”
lamps. This play was first shown at one
of the local theaters and was well
received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Page 32]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bringing Romance to Light</span></p>

<p>Behind many commercial undertakings
there is romance. It may be forgotten
in the press of business, but
human interest is too valuable as a publicity
stunt to be overlooked. It is quite
possible that these romantic stories are
not appreciated at their full value until
a motion-picture publicity expert comes
along and squeezes all the “juice” out of
them.</p>

<p>The motion-picture industry has made
its marvelous progress through the lifelike
stories that predominate in the picture
theaters. It, therefore, only stands
to reason that a real life story would
have a better appealing power.</p>

		V.<br>
		<small>SLIDE AND FILM ADVERTISING CONTRASTED</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>When using the press, you either advertise
in the newspapers or magazines,
or both. So is there more than one
medium at the motion-picture theater.
You can employ a slide or a film to present
your advertisement, according to
which of the two devices you may favor.
I have no axe to grind in contrasting the
two mediums, so will do so in a fair
manner.</p>

<p>As the direct results of my investigations
in numerous motion-picture theaters
of all types in and around New York
and Brooklyn, which set the average for
the rest of the country, I have made the
discovery that there is a far greater
percentage of the manufacturers adopting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Page 34]</span>
slides than films. Why is this so,
then? Personally speaking, I think that
it is due to the fact that the one thing
most in vogue is considerably cheaper
than the other. I say this without any
thought of giving offense to advertisers,
for I know that the wise ones regard
results as of paramount importance
rather than haggling over the question
of price. Maybe, however, they haven’t
been acquainted with the screen long
enough as a publicity outlet to become
sufficiently conversant with the two
channels.</p>

<p>One big drawback is that few of the
slides are attractive enough to become
business producers. It is one thing to
gain attention and another thing to retain
it. It only stands to reason that
you can not expect an audience to be
interested in a dull and commonplace
business any more than you can hope a
hackneyed newspaper ad. to return an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Page 35]</span>
investment. It might have done when
advertising was in its infancy, but to-day,
never.</p>

<p>Even greater pains should be taken
in preparing the matter for a slide, for
the folks that you will shortly show it to
have been educated up to seeing things
excellent in pictorial form. Neither is
just one slide sufficient in order to get
home. You must take into consideration,
too, that yours is only one of a dozen or
more thrown on the screen. The whole
batch are usually projected after the
reels have been shown, in rapid succession.
Since you are competing with a
bunch of advertisers, no matter whether
they be competitors or not, you can not
expect an audience to indulge in a game
of mental gymnastics so as to remember
them all. They are, to use a slangy expression,
tempted to bite off more than
they can chew.</p>

<p>Besides, place yourself in the position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Page 36]</span>
of motion-picture playgoers. They don’t
attend merely to witness a magic-lantern
show or to read books. The former is
out of date, while the latter they can do
at their leisure at home. You can’t be
surprised at them taking offense when
they are forced (that is the strongest
word for it) to wade through a tiresome
number of slides before the next reel is
shown. The practice merely helps to
blackball the advertiser, and that surely
is the last thing to be desired.</p>

<p>If you are still in favor of slides, then
take my tip and get out of the rut; only,
first of all, bear in mind that you are not
preparing something for people to read,
but see. Your ad. will then stand out
above the rest. Introduce pictures, preferably
something to make them laugh.
You can make them move, too! Who does
not remember the Old Dutch Cleanser
lady chasing Dirt, all within the limited
compass of a single slide? You can also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Page 37]</span>
picturize comic stories on similar lines to
those contained in the comic sections of
the metropolitan Sunday newspapers.
Run the series as a serial, and so maintain
the interest from day to day. It is going
to cost you more, ’tis true, but you will be
recompensed amply. Another grave mistake
is to allow a slide to be shown at the
same theater several weeks in succession,
for movie fans are accustomed to a
varied daily change of program and hate
seeing the same thing over again.</p>

<p>My main reason for favoring a film
is because it is the right vehicle in the
right place. The twenty million Americans
go to see pictures in motion, and it
has been proved from experience that the
average movie patron does not object to
a film which combines either instruction
or entertainment. A motion picture taking
an audience through your manufacturing
plant and bringing out all the
selling points you wish would come under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Page 38]</span>
the former heading, while a comedy or
dramatic photoplay incorporating your
ad. would be applicable to the second
designation. By one or the other of these
ways your campaign would get over more
convincingly, and you could conduct it on
an extensive scale. There would be no
possibility about it not sinking into the
audience, inasmuch as good pictures
always do have this effect.</p>

<p>It is also pleasing to know that you
would have no competition to contend
with, for the simple reason that no exhibitor
with brains would think of including
more than one picture of this nature
on his regular program. As the semi-ad.
film is extra, why should spectators be
offended in the least? Or, come to that,
you could stipulate in the contract to
this effect. You would thus enjoy a
monopoly of the screen and not be in
fear of the attention of the audience
being divided. Your film is on the screen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Page 39]</span>
for eighteen minutes or more, whereas a
slide barely occupies a minute.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that I am
wishing to denounce slide advertising;
far from it, let me assure you. It has its
uses.</p>

<p>Naturally, to secure the desired results,
you have to work in co-operation
with the dealers throughout the country.
Now, with a film alone you can accomplish
this much satisfactorily, but an attractive
slide shown on the screen after
the film has been run over fills the gap
O. K. It also acts as a follow-up and
direct-appeal stunt, for it is no earthly
use familiarizing people with your goods
without acquainting them where they
may be obtained locally. Put forward
some attractive proposition and get the
people to action. The slide has always
been a device more eminently suited for
retailers on account of it being inexpensive,
and the manufacturer should therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Page 40]</span>
only employ it as an ally to his
movie publicity campaign. Then both
will work to mutual advantage.</p>

		<small>USING THE FILM TO SECURE FOREIGN BUSINESS</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>At this time, when every live manufacturer
is hastening to place his “made
in America” goods on a large scale in
foreign countries cut off by the European
war, he will, naturally, be responsive to
all publicity mediums which offer value.</p>

<p>Creating a demand for your wares in
new lands is, as one is well aware, a
far harder task than is capturing fresh
business at home, so, if the desired volume
of trade is to be obtained, there must
be no stinting on the advertising campaign
expenditure. It is doubtful whether
there is any publicity outlets that can
outshine the versatile motion picture in
the all-important capacity of a results
bringer. If you are inclined to doubt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Page 42]</span>
pulling powers of this medium, allow me
to draw your attention to some convincing
facts in its favor.</p>

<p>In Serbia, most of the photoplays
shown in the theaters there hail from the
United States. On the authority of Deputy
Consul R. J. Nevakavitch, of Belgrade,
I am able to state that, two years
ago, American fashions became suddenly
popular in Serbia. It is of frequent
occurrence to run up against men—and
it is not confined to the younger fraternity—in
Belgrade with their hair cut a la
American, while their clothes show that
the native tailors are endeavoring to
approach Uncle Sam’s style. In addition,
American types of hats, shoes and boots
are largely in demand.</p>

<p>If films of the fiction variety have
such an effect on foreigners as this, there
can be no possible room for doubt that
advertising pictures pure and simple can
produce even better results individually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Page 43]</span></p>

<p>The main setback to the opening of
business relations in new countries is the
strict conservatism of the dealers, who
have a great dislike to entering into negotiations
with foreign manufacturers, just
because the language, money, weights and
measures are different to what they are
accustomed to. The Belgrade consul
furthermore suggested that this might be
overcome by tackling the prospective consumers
first at the movie shows. The
preference that would ultimately spring
up for American products would practically
compel the local dealer to respond by
stocking the same.</p>

<p>Before the present war was in the air,
a commercial body named British Industries,
Limited, comprising the leading
manufacturers, prepared an eight-reel
film. The principal industries were dealt
with, each merchant being allotted eight
hundred feet in which to tell his “story.”
The complete picture was exhibited, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Page 44]</span>
only in John Bull’s colonies, but in
foreign countries as well.</p>

<p>Germany, too, recently boosted its
industries in foreign markets. The Association
for the Promotion of Foreign
Trade arranged for the taking of a series
of films. These were shown abroad, and
the lecturers, who discoursed on the pictures,
worded their speeches so general
in appeal that the public was unaware of
the true purpose of such demonstrations.</p>

<p>Now, of course, these things have
been knocked on the head, which is all
the more reason why our biggest manufacturers
should get together.</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that an undertaking
on these extensive lines only
appeals to the recognized leaders in each
line of business, so smaller commercial
concerns will find it advantageous to
carry out a movie campaign entirely of
their own.</p>

<p>A good proportion of the motion-picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Page 45]</span>
theaters abroad are always glad to
snap up such pictures free and to include
them on the ordinary entertainment. To
monopolize the advertising in the theater
program, and defray the printing of
same, is a reliable follow-up campaign.</p>

		<small>APPROACHING THE WORKING CLASSES WITH A MOTION-PICTURE PLAY</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>It was the Bard of Stratford who
said that “the play was the thing.” Although
it then referred to the legitimate
stage, as it does now, it can to-day apply
aptly to the motion-picture theater. A
good story is, also, the ideal vehicle for
film advertising.</p>

<p>The twenty million movie fans in this
country frequent their favorite form of
amusement to be entertained, and some
greatly resent the pure advertising or
semi-educationals which they often have
to sit out.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that it is
the one kind of relaxation by which the
working classes are able to get away
from the monotony and hardness of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Page 47]</span>
every-day existence. They, therefore,
want their fare served up in an appetizing
manner. Anything else is apt to
prove a bore, and you can thus see what
kind of a receptive mood by which you
have to approach the average motion-picture
audience. That is why it is advisable
to have your advertising points
ingeniously incorporated in either a comedy
or drama, the former preferably.</p>

<p>The most common type of ad. film is
the industrialog, portraying the processes
by which certain goods are manufactured.
Several of these subjects I have seen at
the picture shows lately were so unnecessarily
padded that they were enough to
send spectators to sleep. No wise advertiser
would attempt to cram in all the
matter he could into the smallest possible
space in his press announcements, neither
should he try it on the film.</p>

<p>Industrialogs undoubtedly appeal
more to a better-class audience, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Page 48]</span>
must be remembered that a good proportion
of the movie theaters are still
nickel shows, which attract the working
classes. These folks see enough of factory
and business life in the daytime, so
they do not want to be inflicted with it
when endeavoring to get away from the
atmosphere. Here you have a large
audience which is extremely difficult to
address via the press, for the majority
go in for hardly any reading at all. Maybe
they haven’t got the inclination or
money to do it. Their custom is certainly
worth while cultivating, and no doubt
they can understand pictures better than
books, as, when the world was young,
pictures were drawn on slabs of stone to
indicate what otherwise could not be
explained. Compelled to go out to work
at an early age is responsible for a good
proportion of the masses being poor
readers and writers. By the motion
pictures, however, you can approach a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Page 49]</span>
public previously beyond your reach.</p>

<p>I recently was commissioned to write
a short comedy scenario for a well-known
tobacco manufacturer, and here follows
the synopsis of the plot:</p>

<p>Bill, a workingman, is enjoying his
pipe of —— Tobacco in the parlor of
his home, when a passerby notices smoke
issuing from the window. Thinking the
house on fire, he brings the fire department
on the scene. They turn the hose
on the house, and, after a severe drenching,
Bill escapes. He is indignant at
being duped by the passerby, and the
firemen also resent being made fools of.
They then turn the hose on the culprit,
who pleads for mercy. Bill offers to
release him if he buys four packages of
—— Tobacco all round. The passerby
agrees, and hurries off to the shop to
buy the same, pacifying his victims, who
are left enjoying the tobacco.</p>

<p>For some things drama is better for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Page 50]</span>
hammering points home, but stick to
comedy as much as you can—it is more
popular with movie audiences.</p>

<p>The French branch of the Remington
Typewriter Company recently had a
photoplay story produced which concerned
a working girl, who, on her
father’s death, was the only support of
the family. Through the firm cutting
down expenses she is dismissed, and
vainly endeavors to obtain another position
as a stenographer. At the end of
her resources, she obtains a Remington
typewriter on the installment plan and
obtains sufficient clients to provide her
with work.</p>

<p>It is seldom advisable to go beyond a
reel, which occupies about eighteen minutes
on the screen, for that is the ideal
length. Audiences will stand this without
a murmur of protest, since they appreciate
one good extra reel on the program.
It matters little whether they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Page 51]</span>
realize that it is advertising disguised.
Quick action is one of the things that
have been responsible for the great present
vogue of the motion picture, so have
your producer compress all he can into
every foot of film. It should then bring
you more than the desired results.</p>

		<small>REACHING THE PUBLIC BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>After an advertising film has been
produced, and the owner wants to get
his investment back with a fair amount
of interest, the question naturally arises
as to the means of distribution. A convincing
motion picture is half the battle
won, but it is obviously practically worthless
unless the prospective purchaser be
reached. Like the placing of ordinary
publicity matter with the press, the marketing
of a commercial photoplay is a
science. No ironclad rules can be laid
down, for the simple reason that everything
depends on the proposition itself.
I shall, therefore, confine myself to
methods that have been employed in
general campaigns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Page 53]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Improving the Ordinary Theater
Plan</span></p>

<p>Once upon a time—and it was not so
far back, either—it was a comparatively
easy matter to coax a motion-picture
exhibitor to take an advertising picture
for one or more days’ showing, but nowadays
it is hard work to do so, for there
are now ten manufacturers to every one
that adopted film advertising as part and
parcel of its publicity campaign in the
past. For another thing, the movie showman
has begun to realize that it is advertising
pure and simple, although an attempt
may be made to disguise this
significant fact. Being a business man,
he naturally considers it only fair that
he should be appropriately remunerated.
His attitude has prevented the screen
medium getting into a rut, since it has
allowed enterprise to enter into the intricate
problem of reaching the public, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Page 54]</span>
condition that was formerly confined to
the actual film. One without the other
only tends to spoil the results.</p>

<p>Here in New York the American
Druggists Syndicate recently brought out
a motion-picture theater accommodating
six hundred, for $150 per day during the
first three days of the week. The ordinary
dramatic and comedy photoplays
were used to entertain audiences, and the
program only differed in that ten minutes
was set apart for a trained lecturer, discoursing
on a series of slides setting forth
the merits of his firm’s goods.</p>

<p>All the box-office receipts went to the
<i>pro tem.</i> exhibitor. Every patron, on
paying for admission, was handed a coupon
which was good for twenty-five cents
at any A. D. S. store in the locality. The
house was filled to overflowing on every
occasion as the result of this dandy
scheme, thus proving the value of a good
premium to which the sporting element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Page 55]</span>
is not attached. It is safe to say that
their products were introduced to many
for the first time, and innumerable new
permanent consumers were added to their
already long list.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Co-operating with the Dealer</span></p>

<p>In the case of a proprietary line, the
dealer has to be “roped in” before a successful
appeal can be made to the public.
He would be first advised of the forthcoming
motion-picture campaign through
the medium of his favorite trade journal.
And, unless it is localized, he will probably
regard it as of no consequence to
him.</p>

<p>When the Jewell stoves and ranges
were, a short time ago, boosted by motion
pictures in numerous towns, the two-reel
film, occupying about thirty minutes on
the screen, which depicted the various
processes in the making of the goods,
was exhibited after the ordinary program<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Page 56]</span>
was over, a small fee being paid for the
privilege. The film was advertised in the
local newspapers, and an arrangement
was effected with the local dealer whereby
his advertising copy linked up with
the film, resulting in people being sent
to his store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Touring Rural Communities with
Films</span></p>

<p>Another excellent plan is to equip a
commercial automobile with cinematographic
apparatus and films, and, under
charge of a trained lecturer, despatch it
to rural communities that may be desired
to reach. There are a good many places
too small to support a movie show even
to-day, and such a one given nightly in
the main street would attract all the surrounding
population. In a way, it would
be a novelty to them, and more especially
so as the exhibition is free.</p>

<p>This was done by Acetylene Publicity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Page 57]</span>
Limited, of London, who toured the small
villages in Britain to demonstrate the
advantages of acetylene lighting and
cooking apparatus by means of a film
lecture. When the weather was not fit
for outdoor shows, a tent was erected,
or else a local hall hired for the purpose.
The route was made to extend to one
year, a stop being made at all villages
and towns passed on the trip, the duration
of which depended on the size and
importance of the place. It was usually,
however, for one night.</p>

<p>Although, as far as I know, this is a
new idea to America, there is no reason
why it can not be adopted successfully
over here. It can be applied to practically
all lines of business appealing to the
consumer.</p>

<p>Mr. C. M. Lemperly, advertising
manager of the Sherwin-Williams Company,
of Cleveland, Ohio, who attribute
a fourteen per cent. increase in actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Page 58]</span>
sales during the last business year to
motion-picture publicity, declares that, as
a medium of small-town circulation, it is
doubtful if there is any better advertising
proposition on the market than the
motion picture. Further to this significant
statement, it is satisfactory to note
that the firms to take up this new medium
continue to increase, and they stick in for
good.</p>

<p>Greatly exaggerated circulations are
held out by inexperienced industrial film
producers, so the advertiser should take
his proposition to the recognized specialists
along this particular line. Their
statements, he will find, will stand being
tested and proved. He will also be assured
that his film will be satisfactory
from a technical point of view.</p>

		<small>INTRODUCING ADVERTISEMENTS INTO MOTION-PICTURE NEWSPAPERS</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A New Opening for Publicity Enterprise</span></p>

<p>It is as well to know, if you were not
already aware of it, that motion-picture
advertising is a passing fad no more.
Instead, it is a tested ad. medium and
is worthy of as much attention as are the
old established publicity outlets, so, if you
are one of its devotees, it is up to you to
impart some originality to your next
movie campaign, for there is danger of
permitting this excellent medium to drop
into a rut.</p>

<p>Since newspaper advertising is so
highly valued, why, therefore, neglect the
splendid chances offered by the motion-picture
equivalent? I refer to the several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Page 60]</span>
animated weeklies published by the
leading film factions. I have approached
the producers on the subject, but they all
seem to be averse to selling their “space,”
because they have their fears that they
will incur the displeasure of the exhibitors
who hire their pictures. This is a
very narrow-minded way of sizing up the
situation, for, if the producers added
additional films to allow for the advertisements
carried, it could be settled in an
amicable manner to both sides, while a
new source of revenue would be opened
to the movie publisher. It would be a
comparatively easy matter to sandwich in
a small ad. film, devised to fit the purpose,
between the news items. As in the
case of advertising that is placed between
the text-matter in the press, it would
possess greater publicity values.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the medium may
be judged by the fact that these animated
newspapers reach something like twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Page 61]</span>
million people of all classes weekly, from
Maine to California.</p>

<p>All film ads., irrespective of the position
they may be placed, would command
concentrated attention and call no effort
on the part of an audience, if the appeal
is presented through the eye and there
is nothing to distract attention or allow
any member to deliberately not give your
ad. at least the once over. In these all-important
points, the motion picture has
a considerable advantage over the press.</p>

<p>Who would think of inflicting the
press agency stuff on film producers?
Yet the English branch of Spratts, the
well-known dog-food specialists, did so
on a recent occasion. They were favored
with a contract to house the special breed
of dogs that were to be employed for
transport work in the Antarctic expedition
and to supply their biscuits. This
news item was given out to one of the
animated newspapers, which was invited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Page 62]</span>
to send an operator. The film concern
snapped up the chance like a starving
man does a slice of bread, for great interest
was centered in the expedition at
the time. Before the camera man’s arrival
at the kennels the chance was not
neglected to display posters and other
advertising matter in the yard. Not only
did they figure prominently on the film,
but the explanatory matter told all about
the firm’s accomplishment. Anything that
possesses genuine news value, and can be
got over by motion pictures, is good for
capitalizing.</p>

<p>It is now extremely difficult to persuade
an exhibitor to put on an ad. film
after his ordinary program for nothing,
so ingenious ruses have to be resorted
to. One firm hit on the brilliant idea of
getting out an animated news weekly of
their own. Half of the reel each week
comprised topical events covered by their
own cinematographer, while the remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Page 63]</span>
portion was a booster for the firm’s
goods. The reel was offered free to
movie showmen, who found the something-for-nothing
bait too good to be
resisted.</p>

<p>Indeed, by looking across the horizon,
there are going to be some surprising
developments in this particular direction
very soon, if I am anything of a prophet,
and those who strike the iron while it is
hot, which is right now, will reap the
advantages.</p>

		<small>EMPLOYING MOTION PICTURES TO APPEAL TO THE CHILDREN</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>In these days of strenuous competition
and enlightenment, the aid of the
children is a factor not to be lightly
reckoned with. If advertisers have discovered
it worth while to appeal to them
through such publicity channels as the
press and special literature, then so must
it be productive of advantageous results
if you pay particular attention to
this element in your next motion-picture
advertising campaign.</p>

<p>The other afternoon, while partaking
of lunch at home, a sample-man came to
the front door and handed the maid a
liberal trial of Shredded Wheat. This
was brought in by her, and my friend
and I myself being both keenly interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Page 65]</span>
in advertising problems, our conversation
naturally drifted to this topic. Much to
our mingled surprise, my friend’s little
girl of twelve chimed in:</p>

<p>“The factory in which Shredded
Wheat is made represents the last word
in cleanliness, and is sanitary in every
respect.” She didn’t say these words,
but they were to this effect.</p>

<p>“How do you know, dearie?” we
asked, dubiously.</p>

<p>“Well, at one of our Sunday-school
entertainments a film came on, showing
the Shredded Wheat plant at Niagara
Falls, and I remember all the details of
the picture.”</p>

<p>What better proof can you have than
that? A child absorbs everything eagerly,
and there is no likelihood of its attention
being diverted elsewhere in the
darkened hall. He can also understand
things better from pictures than from
words, because the eye is the magnet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Page 66]</span>
attracts everything that appears on the
magic white screen.</p>

<p>Nor is this the only example which
has come to my notice lately. I used
to conduct the young folks’ department
in the <i>Motion Picture Magazine</i>, and
in this capacity I recently had the opportunity
of judging the numerous entries
received in the “What I Have Learned
from Motion Pictures” competition. One
of the competitors—a girl of fourteen—stated
that she has seen how the Ford
automobile is put together, the number
turned out in a day, and the roads it can
be made to go over. Take good note of
this fact, too—the film demonstration
was produced in Detroit, Michigan, and
she saw the picture in Coronado, California.</p>

<p>An effort submitted by a boy of thirteen
contained a statement that he knows
how many things are manufactured, although
he neglected to specify whose ad.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Page 67]</span>
films he had witnessed at the theater.</p>

<p>At the present time the schools in
various parts of the country are, more
or less, adopting the motion picture as
part and parcel of their educational
course. They are, for the most part,
only too glad to receive the free hire of
a film depicting how your goods are
made, inasmuch as it costs them at least
$5 for the day’s rental for a single-reel,
anti-ad. industrial picture. Films along
these lines blend well, in that they possess
educational qualities for school use and
general theater consumption besides containing
advertising for your goods.</p>

<p>In some cases the mothers are invited
to these demonstrations, and, even when
they are not, you may rest assured that
their offspring will not overlook enthusiastically
reciting all they have seen.</p>

<p>The largest publishing organization in
England, to boost their morning paper,
the London <i>Daily Mail</i>, had a motion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Page 68]</span>
picture produced covering all the stages
in paper manufacture, from the time the
tree was felled until the finished product
lay on the breakfast table of the reader.</p>

<p>The direct advertising incidents presented
were those of the making of the
paper in their own mills in Newfoundland,
its arrival at their London wharf,
and the spectator was then transferred
to the printing-plant, where the complete
editions are turned out rapidly by the
latest machines. The publishing to catch
early trains to all parts of England was,
unfortunately, omitted. This is done outside
in the wee hours, when it is too dark
for filming purposes, so it had, instead,
to be done at their Manchester branch,
where they print a big northern edition
at daylight.</p>

<p>Prizes of $15, $10 and $5, respectively,
were offered for essays on the picture
written by schoolchildren under sixteen.
There was also a similar competition for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Page 69]</span>
adults. All this was announced in their
daily, and schoolteachers in and around
London were circularized, advising them
when and where the picture would be
shown in their vicinity. They were asked
to kindly bring it before the notice of
their pupils, which they did.</p>

<p>Motion-picture exhibitors availed
themselves of the opportunity to run the
film for three days and Saturday matinee
free, owing to the advance advertising
accorded the picture and its attractive
qualities. At the Saturday matinees the
children attended in full force.</p>

<p>I understand, on very good authority,
that the fifteen hundred feet (one and a
half reels) cost $750 to produce, while
the six positive copies used for circulation
purposes were furnished for the inclusive
sum of $600. The campaign was such
an advertisement and circulation stimulant
that its evening companion, the
<i>News</i>, followed it up by inaugurating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Page 70]</span>
a series of weekly children’s matinees,
admission being in return for a coupon
cut from the paper. Theaters were
bought out for each separate occasion,
the amount varying according to capacity
and location. The program comprised
six reels of educational and comedy films,
a house in a different locality being
bought out each week, and a new variety
of pictures shown. The publication in
question did not employ a film of its own,
but relied upon the advertising received
in connection with the shows as being
sufficient.</p>

<p>With a little adjustment, to suit the
particular line of business, there is nothing
to prevent the London <i>Evening News’</i>
plan from proving equally as effective on
this side of the Atlantic.</p>

		<small>SALESMANSHIP DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE FILM</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Motion-picture publicity is so pliable
that arranging with movie theaters to
put on a film of your product in the making
and equipping salesmen with a reel
and apparatus to demonstrate before
prospective customers does not exhaust
its uses.</p>

<p>I have unearthed a New York manufacturing
concern in a large way of business
who have fathomed the all-important
matter of deriving the fullest value
from their movie-advertising investment.
They utilize their film to teach salesmanship
to the employees. A large room has
been rigged up as a miniature picture
theater, and every week half-hourly pictorial
demonstrations are given to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Page 72]</span>
staff. The film depicts most thoroughly
the manufacture of goods sold by the
firm.</p>

<p>It requires no great stretch of the
imagination to realize that to attempt
this knowledge in the ordinary way is
oftentimes a too lengthy and intricate
task, but the motion picture is so competent
in simplifying the essential details
that, after seeing the movie several
times, even the veriest novice can talk
intelligently to the likely buyer on every
little point in connection with the making
of the goods. Such clinching arguments
make it easier to effect sales, and should
the prospect imagine that the salesman is
attempting to convince him with a lot of
hot-air talk, there remains the actual film
to back up his arguments.</p>

<p>An engineering firm I have come
across in my travels make use of their
private theater to take their out-of-town
customers through the manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Page 73]</span>
processes of their wares. They being
middlemen, the information thus obtained
is passed on to the dubious consumer,
with invariably satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Practically every manufacturing firm
that has adopted—or intends so doing—the
film as a branch of their advertising
campaign may profit by applying the
plans herewith outlined to their own
special circumstances.</p>

		<small>EQUIPPING A PRIVATE MOTION-PICTURE THEATER FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The manufacturer who intends adopting
the motion picture as his advertising
offspring for all time will find it necessary
to install a private theater in his
office building or manufacturing plant,
according to what he may decide suits
him best. This miniature theater can
be made to serve three useful purposes.
One is to try out each new advertising
film before putting it into circulation
and to be on guard for defects calling
for improvement. The second is to
give regular demonstrations before the
employees, so as to keep them up to
efficiency pitch. Thirdly, it is always
available for giving shows for the edification
of prospective customers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Page 75]</span></p>

<p>The authorities throughout the country
are getting exceedingly strict anent
the showing and storing of films, so the
room selected for the purpose should be
made as fireproof as possible, for films
are mighty inflammable.</p>

<p>Although no actual case has come before
my notice, it might be interesting to
compare the example presented by the
wealthy homes in Cincinnati. There are
private motion-picture theaters there
owned by the well-to-do. Both architects
and fire insurance men view the innovation
in the light that no ordinary fire
insurance policy holds good under such
circumstances. Were there a fire to result,
the fire insurance company having
a claim on the same would fight the case
out in the courts to be immune from compensation.</p>

<p>The danger from fire, however, is
considerably lessened if the proper precautions
are taken. But, after you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Page 76]</span>
equipped your private theater, it is best
to call in your fire insurance agent to
investigate and discover what his company’s
action will be in the matter.</p>

<p>A miniature projecting machine will
suit you just as well as one of the standard
machines, which cost three times as
much and consume more current. The
only difference is that the standard machines
are larger and have a longer throw
on a bigger screen. But your theater will
necessarily be a miniature one, and this
makes it ideal for a small projector focused
on a medium-sized screen at a
close distance. The cost of the average
miniature projector—there are several
makes on the market—is $100. Apart
from lessening the danger from fire, such
a machine can be easily connected with
the electric-light current at present available.</p>

<p>There is a dandy film booth listed in
the catalog of a large motion-picture accessory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Page 77]</span>
concern for $50. It is portable
and made of steel, the size being four
feet wide, five feet long and seven feet
high. Only twenty minutes is occupied
in erecting it or pulling down. This, of
course, need only be done when the floor
space is required for some other purpose
when the theater is not required. Inside
the booth the operator can manipulate the
machine with perfect safety, for if the
film was to catch fire, the blaze would be
confined to the booth and the operator
could quench the flames quickly with a
fire-extinguisher.</p>

<p>The screen that gives the best results
and is used in the majority of motion-picture
theaters is that known as the “Mirroroide.”
There are several grades, but
the best is a medium silver white. These
screens are guaranteed for five years
against deterioration, peeling or cracking.</p>

<p>The size of your screen will depend
upon how your room is situated. I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Page 78]</span>
not advise a too small one, for it is desirable
to display all the selling points in
as advantageous a way as you can. I
therefore advocate a screen of not less
than four feet by three feet. The material
for same costs $3.25 per square yard.</p>

<p>You will, of course, have to make provision
for seating accommodation, and it
is optional whether you purchase some
special theater chairs or use those you
have already in use.</p>

<p>A competent operator will expect
from $20 to $25 per week salary, but as
you will only need the services of one
for part time, I suggest that you have
one of your mechanical staff act in that
capacity when his services are needed.</p>

<p>The steel vault or safe is the best
storing-place for films when not in use.</p>

		XIII.<br>
		<small>INTRODUCING COMPETITIONS IN AD. MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The one element in motion-picture advertising
films I have found lacking is
enterprise. I do not mean to say that
this is the case of the pictures themselves,
but in the principle of the whole proposition.
Compare the printed matter gotten
out by the big advertisers. What do
you discover? Why, numerous devices
to attract readers. A photographic firm
offers several hundred dollars in prizes
for the best photographs taken with their
camera. A food manufacturer wants to
know of new receipts for his standard
line, so he pays liberally for such suggestions.
Another food concern will give
an attractive present for a certain number
of labels taken from the packages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Page 80]</span>
their goods. These are but a few examples
of what, in my mind, constitute
enterprise.</p>

<p>All this attracts the interest of the
public and acts as a direct booster for
the goods thus brought into prominence,
but just because you can obtain the attention
of motion-picture audiences with
little effort, that is no reason why you
should let ENTERPRISE go by the
board. Your constant aim should be to
go one better than your competitors and,
at the same time, arouse the most sluggard
to action. There is a certain glamor
about an article being offered free and
money to be had for a little effort, and
the opportunity to strike out along new
lines at the movie theater is awaiting
your prompt attention. No advertiser
has attempted what I am going to propose.
Neither would you attempt what
you have done before through the press
and dealers for the simple fact that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Page 81]</span>
new publicity medium possesses a technique
of its own. This, you can see,
necessitates a different proposition altogether.</p>

<p>One way of gauging the precise lines
you should pursue is by keeping track
of what the ordinary motion-picture producing
concerns are doing. This is why
I advise frequent visits to the theaters,
in which you can combine pleasure with
business. If these producers have experienced
the fact that enterprise pays,
after long and diligent study of what the
fickle public wants, it only goes to bear
out my assertion that users of motion-picture
advertising should emulate their
example.</p>

<p>It also carries much weight in establishing
friendly relations with the exhibitor,
for the average one is no great lover
of advertising films unless offered a fee,
and even then his enthusiasm is of the
watery kind. But, however, if offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Page 82]</span>
a photoplay of the nature which forms
the basis of this article, gratis, he knows
that the joint boosting of him and the
advertiser is a sure tonic for a full house.
He, therefore, may be relied upon not to
let the chance go begging and have it
snapped up by his rival a few blocks
away.</p>

<p>The $10,000 offered for the solving of
“The Million Dollar Mystery” film serial
caused a furore throughout the country.
Briefly, the plan was this: Through the
installments, each getting more complicated
than its predecessor, a million dollars
disappears, and the thief and his
hiding-place can not be located, although
spectators are led to suspect certain characters
and places. The mystery is only
known to those higher up, the correct
solution capturing the big money prize.
The extra installment, which was put out
after the judging was finished, informed
competitors whether they were successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Page 83]</span>
or not. Now, can not you detect the possibilities
of the idea? Supposing somebody
hides something in your advertised
goods and you have all the action revolve
around that situation.</p>

<p>The Universal Company recently experienced
great difficulty in selecting an
appropriate name for a certain feature
film drama, so they released it devoid of
a title and launched an advertising campaign
announcing their intention of paying
$50 for the one accepted.</p>

<p>A no small amount of enthusiasm was
created by the Cines Company in their
plan to remunerate the best scenario with
a thousand dollars, with several smaller
prizes for the ones next best in merit.
Almost everybody is writing photoplays
nowadays, and it would be a dandy idea
if you were to launch an extensive advertising
campaign linking press, dealer,
film and exhibitor. You could then offer
a substantial cash prize for the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Page 84]</span>
photoplays written around your products.
The interest can be sustained when the
films are put out, by inviting criticisms
with the bait of additional prizes. The
latter was done with excellent results in
the Cines contest.</p>

		<small>BRINGING OUT THE INDIVIDUALITY OF DRY GOODS BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The motion picture is the ideal channel
for enterprising dry-goods manufacturers
who want to bring out the individuality
of their goods.</p>

<p>Printed matter, no matter how attractively
gotten up, leaves a lot to be
satisfied, both in appeal and the results.
First of all, you have got to get your
stuff read by discriminating buyers, and
that is no easy matter in these days,
when the mails are swamped with it.
You have got to humor those skeptical
folks who want to be shown that your
statements are correct. They have been
deceived so many times by unscrupulous
advertisers that even the honest ones
come under suspicion. To sum it up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Page 86]</span>
briefly, motion-picture advertising is a
vehicle for pictorial treatment. Your
reader sees the thing in actual reality,
instead of pen paintings or still photographs.</p>

<p>Movie audiences have come to regard
films as next to life itself, and no fraudulent
advertising has crept in on the
screen to shatter their illusion.</p>

<p>You interest your readers with little
effort. At home he or she can toss your
costly literature in the waste-basket without
even giving it the once over. Or,
come to that, if it is a magazine or newspaper
ad., there is a whole mass of
matter claiming attention at the same
time. Your ad., therefore, stands precious
small chance of gaining attention.
But at the motion-picture theater the
situation is entirely different, for your
audience is already waiting to be tackled.
Their attention is literally glued to the
screen. No matter what species of film<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Page 87]</span>
you adopt to get over your arguments,
then the spectators will give it the self-same
attention. They can not do otherwise,
since only one thing appears on the
screen at the same time, and the hall is
too dark for them to do anything else.
It is hardly likely that they will vacate
their seats if they have not seen the whole
program. So the results depend mainly
on how your appeal is presented.</p>

<p>Becker, Mayor &amp; Company, of Chicago,
preferred to do theirs with the aid
of a film carrying the interesting title
of “The Sheep Industry.” It opened
with scenes of sheep grazing on Montana
plains, and then dealt with the whole
operation of making clothes—in their
way, of course—from the time the sheep
were sheared until the clothes were on
the back of the customer. It was a
rather intricate subject, but it was put
over in a clear and entertaining manner.
The selling talk that came to the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Page 88]</span>
out of the mass of material was this:
The sanitary conditions under which the
“Graduate” coats were turned out, and
the several hand operations which ensure
perfect-hanging sleeves, smooth shoulders
and the coat keeping its shape; hanging
the clothes in the stockroom as a precaution
against wrinkles. Then followed
a typical retail store stocking the well-known
“Graduate” and “Woolly Boy”
brands. Their arguments that their
clothes were made of all wool and hand-made
assumed a deeper meaning, adding
the desired convincing touches.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would prefer to have
your statements woven into a comedy or
dramatic photoplay, and so avoid the
direct advertising element. Well, the
Printzess concern had one produced in
three reels, taking about an hour to show,
but incorporated industrial stuff like that
mentioned.</p>

<p>Personally speaking, I should advise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Page 89]</span>
the advertiser to get out a short film at
regular intervals, about a reel in length.
You can then take each thing separately
and release a film at intervals, and so
maintain the interest. You wouldn’t
think of having one big splash at press
advertising and then do no more, would
you? The same principle holds good in
filmland. There is nothing that gets the
goat of a picture-goer quicker than having
to see the same film more than once,
and it should have the run the ordinary
films are given—one day.</p>

<p>Harken back to the Printzess campaign,
their story possessed a very weak
plot, and it was the many interesting
incidents that made the picture entertaining.
Reduced to the bare outlines,
here is the story: A society leader accepts
an invitation to attend an informal
ladies’ costume pageant. She promptly
gets her dressmaker busy on new gowns,
for her wardrobe did not fulfill her exacting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Page 90]</span>
demands. When they are completed,
however, they turn out misfits, and there
is no time for alterations. In her dilemma,
she conceives the idea, suggested by
a magazine ad., of buying a ready-made
gown at the nearest department store. To
her delight, she obtains a stunning dress
that fits perfectly, and creates a sensation
at the pageant. She is declared the best
gowned woman, a gold mesh-bag being
the prize, and gains the title of “Her
Royal Highness Miss Printzess.”</p>

<p>When the Printzess people heard of
the honor paid them, they invited her to
inspect their plant in Cleveland, Ohio.
She has a sister in the town, which gives
her a good motive for making the trip.
After being shown over the works, she is
full of admiration for the workmanship
of Printzess dresses. Back at home, she
muses over fashions, which are visualized
by beautiful living models, attired in
gowns shortly to be introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Page 91]</span></p>

<p>Like with publications, one must, of
course, discriminate between the good
and the bad. What Becker, Mayor &amp;
Company did was to arrange matters
with their string of retailers and loan
each the film. They naturally knew the
best theater suited for their purpose, and
got the exhibitor to show the film for a
small fee at the evening show. When
each was through with it, the film was
despatched to the retailer in the next
town, until the whole territory was
covered.</p>

<p>If you want to do this everywhere at
the same time, it means a little more expense
in having copies of the film struck
off. Pictures of ladies’ underclothing can
hardly be shown in the ordinary way.
The Gossart corset concern surmounted
this difficulty by showing it only at matinees,
to which ladies only were admitted.
The film showed the corsets being fitted
on living models.</p>

		<small>BOOSTING CITIES AND PLEASURE RESORTS BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The first aim of the city boosters and
Chambers of Commerce is to get the
public to visit their communities. How,
then, can this be accomplished? The
usual way is by distributing attractive
literature setting forth everything calculated
to “lure” the visitor, but, in the
majority of cases, the efforts of the publicity
man fail to have the desired effect.
“It is all very well of you to inform
me of the advantages of your city or
pleasure resort,” the man in the street
might say, “but how on earth am I to
know whether it was not written by somebody
with a tendency to exaggerate?
Again, I have to picture things before
my eyes from cold print. Why not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Page 93]</span>
therefore, have this done for me?”</p>

<p>It is for this precise purpose that the
motion picture has made itself conspicuous
as an advertising medium—one differing
from all others.</p>

<p>An exemplification of what can be
done came to the limelight when the
Western Michigan Development Bureau
had a series of films, comprising three
reels altogether, taken to boost western
and northern Michigan. The principal features
of the pictures were the scenes of
such prosperous towns as Grand Rapids,
Muskegon, Petoskey, Cadillac, Manistee,
Frankfort and Charlevoix. These show
the industrial buildings, shipping industry
by lake and rail, public parks, commercial
and residential portions and
recreation resorts. Additionally, the
rapid development of western and northern
Michigan was covered, as also were
the excellent roads, fertile agricultural
lands recommended to prospective homesteaders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Page 94]</span>
fruit orchards, and the various
industries.</p>

<p>Among other towns to employ motion
pictures in a similar way may be mentioned
Pittsburgh and Santa Barbara.
The latter distinguished itself at the San
Francisco Exposition by arranging a
forty-minute show at intervals during
the day. A lecturer heightened the interest
in the films. The exhibit covered a
floor space of four thousand feet.</p>

<p>The St. Louis municipal authorities
made use of a motion picture several
months ago to educate ignorant foreigners
and their offspring to know the main
features of their city in particular, and
America in general. These American
citizens in the making are now able to
say a good word for their home town
when called upon. The film was exhibited
free in suitable places, like a Catholic
church, police station, Jewish synagogue
and a public school. On the first evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Page 95]</span>
over two thousand children, of Italian,
German, Greek, Irish and Russian parents,
were present, along with their
guardians. The picture depicted scenes
of St. Louis, New York Zoo and
American industries.</p>

<p>Because America can learn from
England is my reason for citing the case
of Blackpool, which is the Coney Island
of Europe. In this case a photoplay was
employed, a comedy of fifteen hundred
feet, to be exact. A glance at the synopsis
below will reveal its mirth-provoking
possibilities. I was not able to see the
film, so present the version gotten out
by the advertising manager.</p>

<p>The plot is laid by August and September,
the famous clowns of the Blackpool
Tower Circus, inviting their old
uncle and aunt to see the sights of Blackpool.</p>

<p>The scene opens at Talbot Road Station,
where the elderly relatives are cordially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Page 96]</span>
welcomed and escorted to the
Promenade and Sands. Donkey-riding,
paddling and sea-bathing are indulged
in, and the party then visits the Central
Pier, where the delights of roller-skating
and open-air dancing are enjoyed, to the
accompaniment of many ludicrous and
side-splitting situations.</p>

<p>Then follows the tour of the Pleasure
Beach. Here we see aunt and uncle the
victims of many thrilling, exciting and
amusing adventures—joy rides on the
Velvet Coaster and Scenic Railway, a
trip on the Witching Waves, the descent
of the Water Chute, and many other similar
episodes, lead up to the ascent of the
famous Blackpool Tower, which may be
described as the outstanding feature of
the film.</p>

<p>Other incidents follow, and the picture
finally winds up with a screamingly
funny Golf Tournament, in which the
whole of the characters take part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Page 97]</span></p>

<p>It is the custom to offer exhibitors a
fee for showing an advertising film, but
in this instance the picture was meritable
enough as a comedy to offer a theater in
each town the exclusive rights for a
special price. The example of “Fun on
the Sands at Blackpool”—for that was
the attractive title—may be followed
when you wish to boost some rural or
seaside retreat.</p>

<p>Another point in favor of motion-picture
advertising is that, if done on the
right lines, a film does not appear to be
an ad. Motion-picture fans—and there
are twenty million of them in this country—have
become so accustomed to seeing
scenics and educationals that they
would not realize the true object of city
boosters and Chambers of Commerce.
This is a considerable advantage, for
folks are likely to evince more interest
in a picture.</p>

		<small>ADVERTISING RAILROADS BY THE MOVIES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>For railroad companies, the ideal advertising
medium is the motion picture.
It has something to offer which can not
be done justice to by any other publicity
vehicle. How true this is was brought
home to me the other day while traveling
on one of the elevated lines in Brooklyn.
Sitting next to me in the car were two
young men engaged in conversation, and
I could not help but overhear what they
said to each other.</p>

<p>“I have been trying to decide on a
place for a vacation this summer, but I
have simply grown tired of poring over
advertising literature.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented his companion, “it
leaves so much to the imagination.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Page 99]</span></p>

<p>Here, then, is the crux of the situation—printed
matter of all descriptions
appeals to the brain, whereas the nature
of your business demands that the mental
strain be non-existent. Folks are
more than likely to throw your expensive
literature away unused when you expect
them to use their brains to imagine
things. With motion pictures you don’t
have to—everything is taken in by the
eyes.</p>

<p>You have got to show them. And
how? Well, do not motion pictures fill
the breach admirably? Be honest with
yourself. Is there any other medium in
existence by which you can bring the
actual things before the gaze of a skeptical
public? I will admit, though, that
there are still photographs and lantern
slides, but these only permit snaps here
and there. On the film, however, you
can cover the whole place at one sweep,
so to speak. This is no idle boast. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Page 100]</span>
has been accomplished. Let us, to begin
with, take the prospect of boosting your
line for vacations. The Northern Pacific
Railway Company did theirs by having
a film made depicting the beauties of
their line and Yellowstone Park, recommending
the latter as the ultimate destination
of the tourist.</p>

<p>The results, I am glad to say, were
highly satisfactory.</p>

<p>Although it is unusual, much more
has been done in this particular direction
in Britain than at home.</p>

<p>The Great Western Railway Company
established its individuality by
proving that it is “The Holiday Line,”
for their picture showing the beauties of
the west of England, Wales and Ireland
leaves a hankering to travel by the route
covered by them, if only to pass by the
most charming portions of the British
Isles. The film was hired out free to
numerous movie theaters throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Page 101]</span>
Britain, and the atmosphere of the picture
was further enhanced by the orchestra
playing old English airs.</p>

<p>The Great Northern Railway Company
conceived a different idea in circularizing
their three-reel travel film of
the Scottish Highlands. A descriptive
lecture was prepared in connection with
this, and any lecturer, educational institution
or theater requiring the use of
both could hire them free.</p>

<p>The best way to lessen the expense
and at the same time work to the
mutual advantage is by arranging with
chambers of commerce, etc., who wish
their pleasure resorts to develop. Considerable
success has attended the efforts
along these lines in England.</p>

<p>Southport, a northern seaside resort,
is a case in point. Previous to putting
out a motion picture showing its advantages
as a winter resort, there were very
few visitors in the dull winter months.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Page 102]</span>
The nine copies of this film, however,
were loaned to the various railway companies
running excursions to Southport,
who in turn arranged for the showing
of the film in connection with their advertising
campaign at the picture theaters
in their territory. The outcome was that
the enterprising town reaped a harvest of
winter holiday-makers, who were transported
by the railroads.</p>

<p>The motion picture is also invaluable
in developing towns and various little-exploited
territories, with, of course,
special emphasis on the fact that yours
is the best line to travel by. The Southern
Railroad Company had a film produced
along their line in South Carolina
in order to bring out the possibilities of
farm, city and industrial life in that
State. The film was exhibited in the
North and Middle West.</p>

<p>Nor is this an isolated case, for the
Great Northern Railway and Oregon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Page 103]</span>
Trunk Company joined forces in order
to record the development of central
Oregon on a motion picture. The most
convincing portions of same were those
of the great Blitzen Canal which will
open up one hundred thousand acres of
land, homesteaders arriving, a big cattle
round-up, and vast picturesque stretches
of land which are ripe for settlement.</p>

<p>You can also call attention to the
precautions taken to ensure safety traveling.
The Rock Island Railroad film
dealt with some of the every-day dangerous
experiences of their employees, besides
pointing out the right and the
wrong way of doing each thing. These
pictures served a twofold purpose. In
the first place, regular demonstrations
were given to the other trainmen, so that
they can guard against the dangers that
attend their work. This, in turn, rebounds
on the passengers, who are
ensured being reasonably safe from any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Page 104]</span>
accidents occurring. The public were also
invited to view the film, which could not
fail to leave a favorable impression.
Societies, schools and theaters were also
at liberty to show it.</p>

		<small>GETTING OVER THE PURENESS OF YOUR FOOD PRODUCTS BY A FILM</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The motion picture stands in need of
a nickname. The one most appropriate
would be, “Conveyor of things as they
are.” Not only are audiences regaled on
a feast of comedy and drama, but the aid
of the screen is often sought to educate
them in reforms of various kinds.</p>

<p>And this is where the food manufacturer
can hitch the movies to his next
campaign. Let me tell you this much—the
screen is no ordinary publicity
medium. It possesses a pleasing individuality
of its own. This is the art of
vision. You don’t let your pen loose and
turn out printed matter that but half
satisfies. In these days of food adulterating,
the alert housewife wants to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Page 106]</span>
shown, so the case of the man from
Missouri is not an isolated one. The
film accomplishes more than printers’
ink, and allows you to take people
through your plant, which it is often not
convenient to do in person.</p>

<p>Before we proceed further, I want to
call your attention to a two-reel drama
which was recently put on public exhibition.
It is a lecture in celluloid, and
was produced by the Kalen Company, in
collaboration with Professor Lewis B.
Allyn, who has achieved fame in connection
with the Pure Food movement. He
also acts in this gripping screen drama.
The <i>Ladies’ World</i> ran the fiction version.</p>

<p>The story opens with Jack, the son
of a canned-food manufacturer, entering
his father’s business. Jack is thoroughly
disgusted with the plant, for dirt is allowed
to accumulate and the employees
are sweated. Some are so ill that their
infections are liable to be transferred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Page 107]</span>
the consumer. One of the employees
dies of ptomaines as the result of consuming
the canned goods, and Jack is
urged to reform the existing state of
affairs. To this end he receives instructions
from Professor Allyn, but Jack’s
father will not listen to effecting a reform,
for wealth comes first. The manufacturer
then tries to bribe the Professor
to place his goods upon the Westfield
Pure Food List, but the Professor will
only agree when he makes the needed
alterations.</p>

<p>It happens that Jack is in love with
the daughter of another food manufacturer,
and Jack’s father visits the plant.
The cleanliness and the quality of the
raw materials impress him greatly.</p>

<p>His little daughter steals a jar of
his fruit jelly from the closet and is
taken seriously ill. Then he learns that
his factory is on fire, and we leave him
vowing to build a factory which shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Page 108]</span>
sanitary, the material of the best, while
the health of the employees will be cared
for.</p>

<p>At the lowest estimate, this was seen
by five million out of the total twenty
million movie fans in this country, besides
being read by two million or more
<i>Ladies’ World</i> readers. The film is
sure to make the public more discriminating
than ever. Here, then, is the ripe
opportunity to gain their patronage by
following it up with an effective advertising
film.</p>

<p>This is not mere theory, for the Postum
Cereal Company recently had a
motion picture taken at their Battle Creek
factory depicting the making of Post
Toasties, Grape Nuts and Instant Postum.
The healthy conditions under which
they are made were well brought out.
Human interest—which fans are so partial
to—was added by introducing several
bunches of happy children enjoying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Page 109]</span>
products heartily. An exhibitor was
selected in each town to show the film
for a small consideration, the campaign
proving very successful.</p>

<p>Cadbury Brothers, an English firm
renowned for their cocoa and chocolate,
got out a very interesting film to boost
their cocoa. It showed their cocoa plantation
in Trinidad, the natives gathering
the pods, and various other stages until
the cocoa reached the consumer. Their
other film went further, with special emphasis
on Bourneville, their garden city.
The most valuable points presented were
these: The picturesque surroundings of
Bourneville works, storing raw cocoa,
daily arrival of new milk for milk chocolate,
men’s recreation-ground, a walk
round the plant, showing the airy work-rooms
and open windows, the factory fire
brigade at drill, open-air baths for boys
and girls where they swim during working-hours,
girls’ physical drill, preparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Page 110]</span>
creams ready for covering with chocolate,
covering chocolate creams and decorating
chocolates. All this tended to
favorably impress the millions who witnessed
the film. As it also had educational
qualities, it was offered to exhibitors
free, over three hundred theaters
taking advantage of the offer. It is
usual to pay exhibitors a fee for this
privilege, but when the advertising element
does not unnecessarily obtrude, it
can be put out on its own merits.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of an English
beef-tea preparation called “Oxo” sent an
operator to their ranch in the Argentine.
He filmed a reel of entertaining stuff
which was put out under the title of
“Life on the Oxo Cattle Farms.” The
firm was also wise in only mentioning
the name of their product once.</p>

<p>In this instance movie exhibitors
could hire the film free, and the advertisement
in the trade papers had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Page 111]</span>
a day old before two hundred bookings
resulted. What made the offer so attractive
was to insert free advertising in
the local newspapers announcing where
the film could be seen. Dealers, too, were
put in a good frame of mind, for at the
bottom of the ad. appeared the names of
those stocking Oxo locally. Exhibitors
were also invited to write to the local
schools and get the pupils to attend a
special matinee as their guests, for an
appeal to the children is worth something.</p>

<p>Motion-picture audiences go to see
interesting stories, and it stands to reason,
therefore, that they would better
appreciate your ad. got over in this way
than by any other method.</p>

<p>The plot written around the Hecker
Mills introduces us to the harvesting of
the grain, and in the mills the various
processes come in for due attention. Additional
interest is imparted to “The
Chef’s Redemption”—for that is its alluring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Page 112]</span>
title—by showing how useful the
Hecker flour is in making various kinds
of bread popular in foreign countries.
The ideal conditions prevailing in the
plant carried conviction.</p>

<p>There now exist several firms who
specialize in motion-picture publicity, so
the advertiser need have no fear of
inexperience holding him back. The old
adage, “Do it now,” applies in this case.</p>

	</h2>
</div>

<p>It is not every day that a new and
reliable advertising medium is unearthed,
and it was decidedly a good day’s work
when the selling powers of motion-picture
publicity became known.</p>

<p>You appeal to the public at their leisure
and there is no competition to fear,
as exhibitors will not show more than
one ad. film on a single program. You
also enjoy a monopoly of the audience’s
attention, for folks can only see one
thing at a time in the darkened hall.
The photoplay used to attract the poorer
classes, but now the theaters have divided
up into grades, and the well-to-do and
middle classes are quite as enthusiastic
patrons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Page 114]</span></p>

<p>The manufacturer of automobiles and
accessories can take up motion-picture
advertising with every confidence that it
is going to prove a good business producer.
Naturally the latter depends on
the efficiency of the campaign, for, like
in everything else, system has to be
applied.</p>

<p>It saves the trouble and expense of
having to give numerous tests in order
to prove your claims, and as the film
records them once and for all, you are
avoided any annoying hitches in demonstrations.
The ideal film for advertising
is that which carries the vague definition
of industrial. The Reo Motor Car Company
had such a one taken, and made it
serve three useful purposes instead of
one. The picture depicted conditions in
their plant and how the autos were manufactured.
In the office building they possess
a private motion-picture theater in
which the film is regularly exhibited to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Page 115]</span>
the employees, especially the salesmen, to
keep them efficient. The result is that
they are able to discourse with the completest
knowledge of the goods they have
to sell and enable them to land a sale
easier. The film also comes in handy for
sales demonstration purposes, while, with
alterations, it is made suitable for showing
before the general public to rope in
prospective auto enthusiasts.</p>

<p>A noteworthy film gotten out by the
Ford concern showed an automobile being
erected in two and a half minutes,
when it was speeded off on its own
power. Henry Ford also recently devised
an interesting plan which combined news
with advertising. Each week he arranges
to have the important events in Detroit
filmed and offers the picture to exhibitors
throughout Michigan. In Detroit alone
fifty theaters show the picture. Henry
Ford not only gets himself known as a
booster of his home town, but in addition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Page 116]</span>
avails himself of the weekly opportunity
to boost his cars.</p>

<p>The Pierce Arrow Company had a
film produced setting forth in a convincing
manner the powers and capabilities
of their autos. You can not demonstrate
a motor truck on any street, and this is
where the film triumphs.</p>

<p>The Straker Squire Company, an
English firm, not so long ago introduced,
within the compass of a single film, the
making of the various parts of a modern
automobile, erecting a car in sixty seconds,
trying it out on rough roads, work
tracks and on timber support. Then came
a hill-climbing test and racing cars speeding
at ninety-eight miles per hour.
Lastly, the 980 employees were seen leaving
the works.</p>

<p>The reel depicting the Diamler Motor
Works at Coventry, England, was distributed
in a different manner. The film
was on show at a recent London auto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Page 117]</span>
exposition and caused a hit because it
was an interesting novelty. This plan
could also be allied in connection with
future auto expositions held at the Grand
Central Palace, New York, by enterprising
firms.</p>

<p>And if you want to boost your tires,
here follow some successful methods.</p>

<p>The De Laski and Thropp Circular
Woven Tire Company put out a film
dealing with their methods of manufacturing
tires. It revealed also that it only
takes five minutes to complete one. This
film was used in connection with their
campaign for capturing business in foreign
countries.</p>

<p>In the fifty motoring centers in
Britain, the Goodrich Company has been
conducting film lectures extending over a
year. The film was entitled “From Tire
to Tire,” and in an entertaining way
motorists were educated from the time
the rubber was gathered from the tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Page 118]</span>
until the tire was on the auto. In the
course of the lectures, which were attended
by large audiences, much practical
information was imparted on the use
and care of tires.</p>

<p>A story within a story. Did you ever
think it was possible? If you want to
approach an audience by means of entertainment
instead of education, then it
can be done. A trained scenario writer
is capable of weaving your advertising
story into a comedy or dramatic plot. It
has been accomplished, as witness the
“silent representative” of a Birmingham
concern manufacturing a patent dual rim
for motor cars. The plot concerned a
gang of thieves who robbed a bank messenger
of $25,000. While fleeing in an
auto they are held up by the police, but
escape after a struggle. The police then
chase them in an auto. The crooks,
however, come to a halt through one of
their tires being punctured, and the police<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Page 119]</span>
meet with the same misfortune. It so
happens that the latter’s car is equipped
with the Patent Quick Change Dual Rim,
by which they complete the repairs before
the thieves are half through with theirs.
This allows them to capture the thieves
with ease.</p>

<p>If you intend working the campaign
in conjunction with your dealers, it is
best to get up a list of them in order of
territory and arrange for each to retain
the film for a day. They then persuade,
for a small consideration, the best-class
theater in the town to show the film at
the evening performances, after which it
is despatched to the dealer in the next
nearest town.</p>

		<small>CLINCHING AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY SALES BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The manufacturer of heavy agricultural
machinery and merchandise of an
intricate nature is placed considerably at
a disadvantage, yet, by enlisting the aid
of the versatile motion picture, he can
greatly improve his selling tactics.</p>

<p>The idea of the salesman being burdened
with such cumbersome things is,
naturally, not to be thought of, so his
abilities are confined to selling talk, aided
by the literature of the publicity man.
However convincingly these may be presented,
the one clinching argument is
conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p>Almost every prospective customer,
like the man from Missouri, wants to be
shown, and when his desire can not easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Page 121]</span>
be gratified, his business is often lost. It
is usual in these cases for a firm to pay
his traveling expenses to visit the plant,
but if this is done, very frequently it is
a mighty expensive way and takes the
profit off the deal. The buyer, on the
other hand, may not be able to spare the
time for the trip.</p>

<p>But with a film, all doubt on the subject
is scattered to the wind. The salesman
carries a miniature projection machine,
which is quite inexpensive, in a
natty case. And when he wishes to demonstrate
before the farmer, the blinds
in a room are pulled down and a socket
fixed to the electric light; if this is not
available, he uses acetylene. A table-cloth
is borrowed and tacked to the wall.
He then turns the handle, and as the
possibilities of the machine are unfolded
on the screen, the salesman explains
thoroughly all the difficult points. All
the time the farmer is comfortably seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Page 122]</span>
in a chair and is favorably impressed.</p>

<p>One firm I know went one better with
the producing of their film. They arranged
to have it taken on a farm where
one of their machines was at work, and
filmed the laborers using the implement
in actual practice.</p>

<p>Both the Holt Caterpillar Company
and the M. Rumely Company have successfully
employed the motion picture to
set forth the merits of their farm
machinery.</p>

<p>Another effective plan has been to
arrange a special show with the local
movie exhibitor when the farmers come
to town. Each farmer in the neighborhood
was sent invitations, inviting himself,
wife and children to attend an exhibition
of select photoplays free. They
were entertained with several dramas
and comedies, but the star turn was the
advertising film of the enterprising firm.
This sank in to the right audience in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Page 123]</span>
receptive mood. The exhibition of the
picture to a number of the farmers at
the same time saved much of the salesman’s
time and trouble, and clinched a
whole lot more business in the bargain.</p>

<p>There are times when certain experiments
have to be made with intricate
articles. The dynamite made by the Du
Pont Company, who advocated the use
of same to farmers, is a case in point.
Tests were given in stump blasting, deep
plowing, tree planting, ditching, etc., and
effectively shown to farmers at institutes,
land shows, State and county fairs, and
on other suitable occasions. In all, over
one hundred copies of the same film were
shown at the same time in rural communities
throughout the country. And what
is more in favor of the method is that
the demonstrations were given on winter
evenings, when the farmer had his liberty
and no outdoor tests could be held, owing
to the average weather conditions. Nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Page 124]</span>
must it be overlooked that the extra expense
of this form of publicity was gotten
back in the saving of the dynamite
which would have been necessary in each
actual test. There was also no fear of
failure.</p>

<p>At those times when the farmers attend
important functions on business bent
it is customary to erect machinery and
rent a large amount of space for same.
The demonstrations are cramped and
can never be so thorough in scope as were
a special cinema show to be erected and
demonstrations given at stated intervals
by means of a film. This would be a
good investment, which I can vouch for
by the success that has attended the plan
at various expositions held at the Grand
Central Palace, New York.</p>

<p>On first thoughts, the idea of erecting
a private motion-picture theater in
your office building may appeal to you as
an unnecessary expense, but an agricultural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Page 125]</span>
machinery concern in Hull, England,
has such a place in which to show
its implements to prospective purchasers.
On the whole, it is rather a bore and unpleasant
having to take the prospect
through your plant, and everything is in
favor of the short-cut method. Perhaps
a prospective client will request even to
be shown the machinery in actual use,
and a lot of inconvenience is saved in not
having to trouble already satisfied customers.
This is only of importance when
the film is produced, after which it is
good for all time.</p>

		XX.<br>
		<small>HOW PUBLISHERS CAN CAPTURE BUSINESS FROM THE EVER-ENCROACHING FILM PRODUCER</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>It has been asserted by some that the
movies are a new menace to the publisher.
While not denying the truthfulness
of the statement, I can not pass by
without remarking that the publisher is
to blame for such a deplorable state of
affairs coming to pass.</p>

<p>The motion picture has created a
demand for clean-cut stories, without a
particle of padding. Yet there are publishers
who have continued to turn out
fiction of all kinds with frightfully slim
plots. In the motion-picture play, the
story is the thing. Sometimes one of
these compressed plots that the average
author would weave into a good-sized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Page 127]</span>
novel can be unfolded on the screen in
eighteen minutes.</p>

<p>The longest novel—from a plot stand-point—when
converted into a photoplay,
would not, at the most, provide more
than two hours’ entertainment. As a
rule, they run to an hour or so, while
those that rely, to a great extent, upon description
rather than plot, and are also
deficient in plot qualities, could not be
put on at all.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the person who
has reaped most of gold for this fiction
adaptation mania is the author. Now,
why shouldn’t the publisher likewise benefit?
Well, he can, if he gets into action
right now.</p>

<p>Down to date, the greater part of the
adapted fiction—short stories and serials—has
not been filmed until after publication,
when, of course, it would not
increase the sales one little bit. If all
are to profit, united co-operation is necessary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Page 128]</span>
When a piece of fiction—no
matter whether it be a short story, a
serial or a novel—appears, an endeavor
should be made to arrange with a film
concern that the photoplay should appear
simultaneously with it in fiction form.
Tagged on to the end of the film—or
both beginning and end for preference—should
be a notice announcing where the
printed story can be seen. This publicity
the publisher will reciprocate by informing
the readers of his publication that
they can see the photoplay version at the
movie theaters, and so forth.</p>

<p>The millions that visit the moving-picture
shows daily have come to regard
their favorite amusement as a “Guide to
Literature.” They prefer to see it on
the film first, because it is the quickest
and easiest way to arrive at a decision.
It is also the truest test.</p>

<p>Since the movie manufacturers have
made good with the speeding-up process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Page 129]</span>
in stories, so must the offending publishers
follow suit if they do not wish to
be put out of business.</p>

<p>When a film form of a well-known
copyright-expired work has been exhibited,
a run on the cheap editions has
occurred, while in many cases the book dealer
has been totally unprepared for
the demand. The publishers should keep
a weather eye on the different releases
week by week and watch out for opportunities.</p>

<p>Fresh developments have resulted in
more business slipping out of his hands.
The latest move of the film producer is to
produce an original serial play, have the
scenario author write it up in book shape,
add some photographs from the film, together
with a signed one of the leading
actor. The first attempt along these
lines has been distributed among the picture
shows in lots of twenty-five or more
at 15 cents per copy. The first edition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Page 130]</span>
fifty thousand copies sold like hot cakes,
so to speak, and the second edition sold
well.</p>

<p>Why, I maintain, should not the publisher
have the business that is legitimately
his? There is little chance of
co-operating with the ordinary one- and
two-reel photoplay, as the fiction rights
of these are given to the motion picture
magazines, whose staffmen write them
up. There are, however, opportunities
for the publishers to handle the big
feature photodramas, as well as the
linked series and serials. It is a paying
proposition for all concerned if operated
on the right lines.</p>

		<small>ADVERTISING YOUR NEWSPAPER WITH A MOTION PICTURE</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Enterprise is a restless thing. Once
let it remain still and all the good work
is undone. This fact is brought more
closely home in the case of a newspaper,
for enterprise does so much to hold a
reader. One stunt is soon forgotten, and
it is therefore imperative to keep the ball
a-rolling.</p>

<p>You, as a newspaper man, know the
huge following the motion picture has,
and if you are a small-town member of
the fourth estate I want your attention
right now. Mr. Big City, your turn will
come next.</p>

<p>Several small-town newspapers have
tried out the following plan successfully.
A prize, usually $25, is offered for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Page 132]</span>
best one-reel scenario, comedy or dramatic,
as you may choose, only it must
possess a plot which can be effectively
taken amid familiar local surroundings.
Usually the editor, dramatic critic and
the movie director act as the judges.</p>

<p>This is followed by a voting contest
for the selection of the most beautiful
young woman and handsomest young
man in town to play the heroine and
hero, respectively. A prize of, say, $25
each, should be offered.</p>

<p>Nominations are best made by coupon,
accompanied by a photograph. The
judges can weed out the hopeless ones
and print the photographs of the good-looking
ones in the newspapers, as well
as having them thrown upon the screens
of the local motion-picture shows. Interest
may be maintained each day by
announcing the standing of the candidates.</p>

<p>It is up to readers to vote for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Page 133]</span>
favorites, who, if successful, would be
trained to act in the prize-winning story.</p>

<p>The advantages of the indirect advertising
campaign are many, and it will be
found to pull more results than ordinary
advertising could accomplish in a lifetime.
I say this in all seriousness.</p>

<p>In the first place, almost everybody
has a hunch to write a photoplay, but
few see their efforts on the screen. In
a local contest they stand more chance
of making good. The winner is aware
that there is more than $25 and local
fame awaiting him. His success does
much to remove the barriers from the
doors of the regular motion-picture producers,
who, knowing he is one of the
“arrived,” give his future efforts special
consideration.</p>

<p>The acting bug is strong within
many, especially boys and girls in their
teens. The speaking-stage used to be
the attraction, but nowadays they get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Page 134]</span>
screen-struck instead. Can’t you imagine
how proud the winners would be to act
in a photoplay and be viewed by their
admiring friends? It may prove a stepping-stone
to an engagement with a big
film company. Events have turned out
this way before now.</p>

<p>Important links in the chain are the
local motion-picture exhibitors. All are
fully alive to the value of a photoplay
possessing a strong local appeal. Therefore,
if you agreed to announce in your
newspaper where the picture was being
presented, you would find all the local
exhibitors clamoring to hire it. You
would probably be able to charge a nominal
fee to help cover the cost of production,
for it is not as if the photoplay is
advertising pure and simple. You get
your publicity as the promoter of the
production.</p>

<p>Apart from getting your newspaper
on the lips of everybody, every candidate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Page 135]</span>
would enlist the aid of friends to secure
votes, the additional coupons required for
this purpose increasing your circulation
many times over, temporarily, of course.
On the other hand, you would secure
new permanent readers.</p>

<p>You may be too far removed from
such movie-producing centers as New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Jacksonville.
Fortunately, however, there exist
private concerns throughout the country
which make a specialty of local work.</p>

		<small>SELLING SHOES BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Shoe Manufacturer, take your
choice. Which would you prefer to
boost a brand of shoes by—an industrial
film, a comedy photoplay or a trick film?
That is a matter for you personally to
decide, for my responsibility ceases after
mentioning how each type of motion picture
has been employed by other shoe
manufacturers.</p>

<p>The George E. Keith Company, manufacturers
of Walk-Over shoes, introduced
themselves to the motion-picture
public with “The Making of a Shoe,”
said film being exactly one-reel in length.
The camera man went to Campello,
Massachusetts, for his material, and first
panoramed his camera outside the Walk-Over
plant. Once inside, evidently nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Page 137]</span>
escaped his notice, for he covered
everything, from the leather inspection
to the polishing of the finished soles.</p>

<p>Credit must go to the Krohn-Fechheimer
Company, of Cincinnati, for being
the first to present photoplay stars.
Their film, “A Footwear Romance,” featured,
to use a studio term, Ruth Stonehouse
and Bryant Ashburn. It was easy
to capitalize these two attractions, so full-page
announcements were taken in the
leading motion-picture magazines.</p>

<p>This was how the fans were appealed
to: Glancing across the aisle on the
Pullman, Edward Blair saw a pair of
feet so small, so bewitchingly dainty,
that at once he lost his heart to the
pretty feminine possessor. But who was
she, and where was she going? Resorting
to a bit of clever detective work, he
found that she wore the Red Cross shoe—a
clue that led up to some startling
information. But afterwards came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Page 138]</span>
greatest shock—when he discovered her
as the servant in the home of Miss
Eugenie Hatton, the girl he must marry
to win the fortune of his eccentric uncle.</p>

<p>How would you have this story end?
Would you have him marry the servant-girl,
whom he really loves, or Eugenie
and a fortune? How it really does end
will be a big surprise to you.</p>

<p>The star players, of course, were especially
mentioned, as well as advising
readers to see the film when it came to
their town.</p>

<p>The opportunity to present the direct
appeal was not overlooked, for the
Krohn-Fechheimer Company offered to
send the complete story of the film. With
the synopsis was enclosed a card of
introduction to the local Red Cross
dealer.</p>

<p>I understand that the film was handled
by a Red Cross dealer in every
town, who arranged for its showing at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Page 139]</span>
the most desirable local photoplay theater,
calling attention to the fact in his
newspaper announcements.</p>

<p>The trick film is capable of putting
over many amazing advertising stunts,
and for impressing a name on the public
it can not be surpassed, if equaled. While
I can not recall any American shoe
manufacturer having adopted same, we
can take a leaf out of Germany’s book.</p>

<p>A clever idea was carried out by the
Dorndorf Shoe Stores, which establishment
used a film that presented a jumbled
heap of letters, these eventually
merging into the word “Dorndorf.”</p>

<p>The same concern employs another
film which shows shoe-boxes traveling
unaided from the shelves to the customer,
who allows the shoes to try themselves
on his feet until a pair proves suitable.
Then appears the apt subtitle, “Dorndorf
Shoes Sell Themselves.”</p>

		<small>FILM ADVERTISING FROM THE PHOTOPLAYER’S VIEWPOINT</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Business and art do not usually go
together, but this can not be said of
Edward Earle, the popular photoplayer.</p>

<p>“Perhaps why I evince such a great
interest in advertising,” Mr. Earle began,
“is the fact that without it a photoplayer
would soon find his popularity on the
wane. A player must, first of all, possess
ability, as otherwise the most brilliant
publicity campaign in creation will
fizzle out.”</p>

<p>Having thus broken the ice, I got
down to business.</p>

<p>“Do you advocate the film as an
advertising medium?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, and then, no,” he remarked,
thoughtfully. “It is the forceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Page 141]</span>
methods adopted in film advertising
to which I am opposed, and which, incidentally,
are responsible for the medium
not having attained the popularity of its
older sister—press advertising.</p>

<p>“One of the points in favor of the
latter is that you are not compelled to
read the advertisements. They win out
on their own merits, for if one is sufficiently
compelling your attention is automatically
attracted.</p>

<p>“But the ‘make-up’ of the motion-picture
theater screen differs in that only
one thing may be presented at a time. If
an advertising film is unfolded, you have
no other alternative in the darkened hall
than to give it your attention.</p>

<p>“Nothing is more abhorrent to the
people of this democratic country than
compulsory methods,” Mr. Earle continued,
“and it is my belief that motion-picture
advertisers unconsciously get in bad
with their prospects. It is a human trait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Page 142]</span>
in buying to be able to choose between
goods of the same kind, but as the
exhibitor only rents out his screen to
one advertiser in each trade, the public
can not possibly discriminate.</p>

<p>“You will have to go far to find a
magazine or newspaper that doles out
monopolies to advertisers. I honestly
think that this condition of things has a
tendency to make advertisers dull and
listless. Competition is the life and soul
of publicity, and makes the advertisement
writer put plenty of ‘pep’ into his copy.</p>

<p>“Once the present forceful methods
in film publicity presentation are abolished,
the medium will enter an era of
prosperity.”</p>

<p>“Do you consider this treatment can
be avoided?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That all depends,” Edward Earle
replied. “You see, the average photoplay
program occupies two hours. To
lengthen this in order to include advertising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Page 143]</span>
picture, the exhibitor has either to
open his show earlier or else curtail his
performance. The former step would
not be practical, as his busy times are
from seven to eleven in the evening, in
which hours he has to give two performances.
The latter move, however, would
not meet with the approval of his
patrons.</p>

<p>“If the advertising film was about one-reel
in length, the exhibitor could just
about squeeze it in. This should be
shown at one theater for only a day, as
the regular fans dislike to see a picture
more than once. It will also allow other
advertisers a look-in.</p>

<p>“If the ad. story can be told in less
than one thousand feet, so much the
better. I notice some commercial producers
offer to release several subjects
by different advertisers on the same reel.
I know in the case of press advertising
that it is a serious mistake to cram as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Page 144]</span>
many words as possible into a small, displayed
announcement, but in film publicity
the reverse is the case.</p>

<p>“The more material you compress into
a film the snappier it will be,” commented
Mr. Earle, “though clearness should not
be overlooked. The bugbear in the
motion-picture industry to-day is padding,
and I should be sorry to see national
advertisers fall for it. A film may
occupy the screen longer, but it will certainly
not impress spectators any the
more.</p>

<p>“The big advertisement has its place
in filmdom if the story succeeds in maintaining
the interest from beginning to
end, but you must remember that a whole
page magazine ad. can be read inside of
two minutes, while a feature, its motion-picture
counterpart, demands at least an
hour of a fan’s time.</p>

<p>“But there is no room for the big
feature in the regular motion-picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Page 145]</span>
theater. If I am not mistaken, there will
spring up a chain of photoplay theaters
in the large cities to which the public
will be admitted free. At these ‘billboard
stations’ short, regular photoplays will be
sandwiched in between the ad. films so
as to attract the folks inside.”</p>

<p>Mr. Earle raises some interesting
points, which deserve the consideration
of every national advertiser.</p>

		<small>ADVERTISING FILM CIRCULATION</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Motion-picture advertising has presented
its crop of new problems, and
probably none so involved as circulation.
Let us, first of all, compare the film with
printer’s ink. To my mind, a motion
picture is like a press agent’s story syndicated
to a chain of newspapers throughout
the country, yet it is different in
some respects. A write-up may be released
for simultaneous circulation and
published in several thousand newspapers
on the same day, but this stunt would not
be practical in the case of a motion picture.</p>

<p>The regular photoplay producers have
specified release dates for their productions,
and although several thousand exhibitors
may book the same production,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Page 147]</span>
their dates will be spread over a period
of about six months. Each print supplied
by the film manufacturer costs the
exchange at least $100. The leading
theaters are in a position to pay the high
rental demanded for first run, but the
exchange has to keep that print working
overtime in order to make a profit, so it
is hired out to other exhibitors at proportionately
reduced rates.</p>

<p>Now, suppose you have a one-reel
industrial film produced. The negative,
we will say, costs $500, but for every
print you need the charge is $100. Now,
if you are going to have your film shown
at every theater simultaneously, it means
that you will have to supply one print
for each theater. As the picture will
only be retained for a day or so, it is
extremely doubtful whether the expense
will be justified, so it is best to utilize
only one print in each territory. A film
does not generally begin to show signs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Page 148]</span>
of wear and tear until after about six
months’ constant use, and, if we allow
one day for each theater, each copy of
the picture will be shown in about 156
theaters. Allowing an average audience
of one thousand at each of the two
evening performances, the film will have
been seen by 312,000 people. There are
more in these than appear on the surface,
for, although a publication may guarantee
such a circulation, you have to allow for
those readers who skip all advertisements.
In the motion-picture theater this
can not be done, as only one thing is
shown on the screen at a time, and in the
darkened hall a spectator can not turn
his attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>Another thing which must be taken
into consideration is the fact that the
one-reel film occupies the screen for
eighteen minutes, which is several times
greater than the time a reader devotes
to a press advertisement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Page 149]</span></p>

<p>The film must be charged to the copy
writer’s account, for an exhibitor charges
from $12.50 to $50 per week for renting
out his screen for advertising purposes.
A film, I admit, represents a big outlay
for the copy writer’s services, but it is a
worth while investment.</p>

<p>The Maxwell Motor Sales Company,
for instance, had a series of films produced
which were presented over five
thousand times in America, Canada,
Australia and England. It is estimated
that they were seen by at least two
million people. The circulation was
mainly achieved by dealer co-operation,
the dealer making arrangements with the
local exhibitor and presenting free tickets
to all who cared to accept same.</p>

<p>Those advertisers who do not make
their appeal to the general public will
find that quality circulation is far preferable
to quantity circulation. Hoggson
Brothers, the New York contracting designers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Page 150]</span>
realized this when they showed
their film exclusively to business men
who contemplated having buildings erected
or remodeled.</p>

<p>The film owned by the Columbia
Paper Manufacturing Company, of
Washington, D. C., was exhibited by one
of their traveling representatives before
printers in various parts of the country.</p>

<p>The film which boosted the products
of the Peabody Coal Company, of Chicago,
was shown at a number of educational
institutions, as well as to individuals
interested in the coal business.</p>

<p>The Reliable Incubator and Brooder
Company took advantage of a recent
poultry show held at Quincy, Illinois, to
present a motion picture, “taking spectators
through their plant and showing
their poultry-raising methods.”</p>

<p>Both the French China Company, of
Sebring, Ohio, and the National Tube
Company were represented at the Panama-Pacific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Page 151]</span>
Exposition by motion-picture
exhibits.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, the motion
picture becomes a catalogue in celluloid.
It is more powerful than the printed
page, and helps to substantiate the claims
of the salesman. Whether it is best
suited to general or class circulation is
determined at the outset, after which it
is necessary to seek the right channels,
these being determined by the character
of the proposition.</p>

		<small>COVERING THE MOTION-PICTURE FIELD BY MAGAZINES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Not so long ago photoplay audiences
were content to just see the films through,
so the players remained mere shadows
until the industry advanced a few steps
further, when stock companies were
formed. Now, this meant that the fans
saw the same actors, week in and week
out, instead of a fresh face every time,
and, very naturally, they began to evince
an interest both in the screen players and
the brands of photoplays. Then the
motion-picture companies were bombarded
with inquiries asking for the name of
the man with the curly hair, and so forth.</p>

<p>It occurred to one of the film companies
that there was scope for a magazine
appealing expressly to the fans, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Page 153]</span>
now the motion-picture field is represented
by nearly a dozen publications of
all sorts and descriptions.</p>

<p>The motion picture to-day has such
a tremendous hold that it is estimated
that there are twenty million fans in this
country. Just think of it—one-fifth of
the total population.</p>

<p>It has been truthfully stated that
motion-picture fans are the most inquisitive
folks in the world. They make it
their business to read every word in their
favorite photoplay magazine, and this
ensures an advertiser’s announcements
being read.</p>

<p>I have discovered that the majority
of the readers are girls and women, but
the publications are taken in the homes
and eagerly devoured by the rest of the
family.</p>

<p>It has long been thought that motion-picture
audiences only comprised the
poorer classes, but now the habit has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Page 154]</span>
spread to folks in comfortable circumstances.
These publications reach the
largest city as well as the smallest rural
community, and are equally good for
mail order or dealer campaigns.</p>

<p>The photoplayers thrive on popularity,
and you would be surprised what a
lot a fan thinks of his or her idol, so the
appeal goes closer home when the copy
is linked with the name of a prominent
screen performer. For instance, in one
publication the Charles William Stores,
the New York mail-order house, ran
three cuts of popular players in the full-page
ad. They first showed Harold
Lockwood wearing one of their spring
hats; the second was of Romaine Fielding
attired in one of their business suits,
while Marguerite Clayton was seen with
one of the dainty afternoon dresses on.
In the same issue Ruth Stonehouse testified
to the merits of Sempre Giovine
Soap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Page 155]</span></p>

<p>The logical follow-up medium for your
film is the motion-picture publication
field, for every fan takes regularly at
least one publication devoted to photoplays,
and the cover of national magazine
or periodical you have in mind may only
catch his eye at the news-stand.</p>

		XXVI.<br>
		<small>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS OF ADVERTISING BY MOTION PICTURES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>There is a great future before advertising
by motion pictures, and it is only
with the most careful deliberation that I
have concluded in what way the future
developments will assume shape.</p>

<p>The medium is practically only in its
infancy to-day, for, despite the vast possibilities
offered, most concerns have
seemed to favor following the same
groove. I do not wish to insinuate that
this is because the work has been placed
in the hands of the several firms specializing
in the producing of commercial
motion pictures. Such a thing never
entered my mind. I do think, however,
it is due to the fact that advertisers have
been reluctant to deviate from the exploited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Page 157]</span>
fields. The path of the pioneer
may be speculative, but it need never be,
if the alert advertiser studies the other
end of the business, where photoplays
are made and exhibited for entertainment
purposes. It is a reliable thermometer
to watch, believe me. That much only
stands to reason, for are not the majority
of ad. films shown on programs along
with the ordinary photoplays?</p>

<p>To achieve permanent results, the
spasmodic plan at present prevailing must
be abandoned. You would not dream of
inserting a solitary one advertisement
in the press and then expect it to be
business-bringing for all time, would
you?</p>

<p>Well, perhaps you have gotten the
hunch that the film is a permanent ad.
So it is, only, to have it do so, you must
keep it on the rounds to folks who have
not seen it before. It is the greatest
mistake in the world to present the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Page 158]</span>
film before the identical audience day
after day. Let us come to an understanding.
Would you employ the same
copy in the newspapers in more than
one issue? Hardly. You would alter
it so as to eventually capture the most
skeptical customer. You must, then,
apply the same methods to film publicity.</p>

<p>And this is why I hold the opinion
that a moving-picture expert will be on
the staff of every large manufacturing
concern. His duty will be to present his
employer’s copy to the best possible advantage
on the film. At the same time,
each large advertiser will lay down a
film-producing plant. It is going to
incur him a big initial outlay, what with
an artificial light studio, accessories,
stock company and developing plant, but
he will obtain his expense back by the
considerable saving effected in not having
to have his work done outside. Naturally,
this expenditure will not be justified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Page 159]</span>
unless the advertiser is prepared to
launch his publicity campaign along the
same extensive lines as in the press. We
shall find him, I fancy, releasing new
films with clockwork regularity. By having
all the facilities at his command for
the producing of these, he will be dependent
on nobody, and can impart the
necessary individuality into his pictures.</p>

<p>His first big move will be to coax
some of the leading movie stars to be
featured in an advertising film which is
to be produced in an elaborate manner.
The fee for his or her services will be
very large, but, on the other hand, exhibitors
will simply clamor for the free hire
of the film, with, say, Earle Williams as
a bachelor who has his housekeeping
worries lessened by some article on the
market. The great saving in the fees
paid to exhibitors for showing an ordinary
ad. film will be effected. Such a
picture would also secure a larger circulation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Page 160]</span>
apart from the fact that movie
fans will sit up and take notice when they
behold their idol in a role similar to the
one mentioned. This will mean the ad.
appeal getting over more convincingly.</p>

<p>The next development will be the
advertising film serial. As you are probably
aware, the dramatic serial has taken
the photoplay world by storm. It is the
ideal vehicle for the advertiser, inasmuch
as it permits the interest to be retained.
The story, if sufficiently gripping, will
keep audiences in suspense from one
week to another. There will be none of
those trite stories that form the basis of
ad. films to-day. An aim will also be
made to avoid permitting the advertising
element to obtrude.</p>

<p>One peculiar thing about the motion-picture
equivalent of the newspaper is
that it does not carry advertisements, but
this state of affairs will not exist much
longer. For these mediums a special type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Page 161]</span>
of ads. will be needed. They will be
sandwiched in the news items and be of
a topical character, so as to preserve the
same atmosphere. For instance, when
a battleship is launched, you won’t forget
to be told the brand of the bottle of
champagne that is smashed upon the
vessel.</p>

<p>The feature production does not appeal
to me much as a paying proposition
for the advertiser. It is too reminiscent
of trying to cram as much matter as
possible in a single advertisement.</p>

<p>One thing to be said in favor of the
film is that it is a perfect paradise for
the honest advertiser, for, as yet, fraudulent
advertising has not been allowed to
mingle with the genuine.</p>

<p>The plant of a food manufacturer,
for instance, may be unsanitary and inferior
raw materials used. Should this
type of business man be unscrupulous
enough, he might have his conditions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Page 162]</span>
his plant pictured as ideal, by faking the
whole thing in a film studio.</p>

<p>What is sapping the progress of film
advertising is that no systematic method
of circularizing exists, for, naturally, this
end of the process is as important as the
picture itself. What I predict is publicity
agencies specializing in motion-picture
theaters. Then when an advertiser
has a high-class proposition, a circuit of
high-class theaters in select localities will
be chosen, thus eliminating waste circulation.</p>

		XXVII.<br>
		<small>BOOSTING YOUR TRADE WITH A POPULAR PLAYER</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Motion pictures are to-day a force to
be reckoned with, and the national advertiser
can not do better than to take advantage
of the weaknesses of the fans,
who are enrolled from all walks of life,
and no one, from the boy in short pants
to the old man of seventy, is immune.
When they get the motion-picture bug
badly—and the majority succumb—their
interest in a photoplay only really commences
when they view it at their pet
theater. They next turn to their encyclopedia—the
latest issue of their favorite
photoplay publication—in which they
will probably find the story of the play
and some dope on the producing of it.
By the time they are through they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Page 164]</span>
sure to know the photoplay from A to Z.</p>

<p>The star player is a greater magnet
than the play. The fans literally pester
the lives out of their screen idols via
Uncle Sam’s mails, and generally implore
their pet magazine to publish an interview.
Practically anything linked with a
motion-picture star is sure to find a ready
response. You can not secure a popular
photoplayer to appear in a thinly disguised
advertising film, so the next best
thing you can do is to work along
lines which other advertisers have successfully
tried out. Here follow some
examples.</p>

<p>Pearl White, of “Exploits of Elaine”
fame, was shown in an ad. which appeared
in the <i>Motion Picture Magazine</i>,
wearing Vantine’s Panama hat.</p>

<p>Mary Pickford owns a Maxwell
Cabriolet, so the manufacturers secured
a snapshot of her boarding her car. The
photograph was used in a New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Page 165]</span>
<i>Morning Telegraph</i> ad. to back up the
following argument: “This car is the
easiest car in the world for a woman to
drive. That is why Mary Pickford
selected it.”</p>

<p>A photograph of Lillian Walker in a
smiling pose accompanied an ad. in the
<i>Motion Picture Magazine</i> for Carmen
Complexion Powder. This was the significant
argument: “One that adds every
charm to your complexion, as well as Lillian
Walker’s, without seeming artificial.”</p>

<p>Marguerite Snow supplied the following
testimonial for Sempre Giovine:
“I am pleased to attest to the merits of
your skin preparation, Sempre Giovine,
conscientiously, having found it a necessary
adjunct to my toilet table. Its use
after a day out in all kinds of weather
leaves the skin in a velvety condition.”
This supplied the “pep” to a full-page
announcement in the <i>Photoplay Magazine</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Page 166]</span></p>

<p>Mary Charleston permitted her name
to be used in connection with Dr. Bellin’s
Wonderstein for a New York <i>Morning
Telegraph</i> ad.</p>

<p>The Richardson Silk played up Mary
Fuller prominently in a displayed advertisement
which graced the columns of
the <i>Motion Picture Magazine</i>. “Free:
Mary Fuller’s Own Pillow” was the
headline. Below the cut of the pillow
appeared Miss Fuller’s testimonial:
“I prefer this design to any I have
seen.”</p>

<p>The Red Cross Shoe manufacturers
started off their full-page ad. in the
<i>Photoplay Magazine</i> as follows: “Are
You Making the Mistake Ruth Stonehouse
Did?” “I had always heard so
much about the comfort of your shoes
that I did not realize how very stylish the
different models were,” ran her quoted
letter.</p>

<p>Even child players can be turned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Page 167]</span>
advertising account, as witness the following
full-page ad. in the <i>Motion Picture
Magazine</i>: “Your Little Friend,
Little Billy Wirth, Whose Mother is
Glad to Testify to the Value of Imperial
Granum, the Unsweetened Food.”</p>

<p>National advertisers, up to the present
time, have paid considerably more attention
to the heroines than the heroes.
Possibly it is because it is much easier
to appeal to the women, but the odds
should be more balanced. Tobacco, hosiery
and sporting-goods manufacturers
are to name just three kinds of advertisers
who could employ a prominent
male player to advantage.</p>

<p>Why not name the next new branded
article you put on the market after a
motion-picture star? I happen to have
advance information of a cigar manufacturer
who has christened a new cigar
after King Baggot. I understand, too,
that Lillian Walker, Edward Earle, Leah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Page 168]</span>
Baird and Eleanor Woodruff are open
to receive offers.</p>

<p>How can the photoplayers be approached?
In the first place, a player
can not secure too much publicity, and if
he neglects this important factor he loses
much of his popularity.</p>

<p>Great as is a motion-picture player’s
need for publicity, he will seldom allow
his name to be exploited by an advertiser
without adequate remuneration, as he
feels that he, too, should reap some of
the financial benefit.</p>

		<small>BOOSTING YOUR BUSINESS WITH AN ADVERTISING MOTION PICTURE</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Are you a storekeeper who would
blazon the path of originality, yet would
not object to the increased outlay?</p>

<p>The advertising powers of the motion
picture have been fully realized by the
large manufacturers of this country, but
the average retailer has confined himself
to the slide.</p>

<p>With a film, however, you can cause
a small-sized sensation in your town, for
folks will look upon your effort as a home
product. You can not, of course, live
upon publicity, and the true test will be
the extra amount of business it brings.
Once the interest of people is aroused,
there can be no doubt concerning the
latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Page 170]</span></p>

<p>The most suitable kind of photoplay
is the comedy. You may have a commercial
motion-picture photographer located
near by, in which case you can avail
yourself of his services. Failing this,
however, there are a number of concerns
who do nothing else but produce films for
commercial purposes.</p>

<p>If you have the film produced along
economical lines, you should get the negative
produced and developed for an
inclusive charge not exceeding seventy-five
cents per foot. A useful length
is from two to five hundred feet. Then
you will want a positive, which will cost
you ten cents per foot.</p>

<p>In regard to the actual producing of
the photoplay, I strongly advise you to
have some scenes taken amid familiar
local landscapes. You might persuade
members of the local dramatic society to
attend to the acting end. It would improve
the play if you could manage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Page 171]</span>
introduce well-known local citizens. This
will save you the expense of having to
hire regular motion-picture actors, and
the folks who see the film will not be
critical as to the technical defects. The
concern you engage to put on the picture
will send along a capable director, who
will knock the players into passable shape.</p>

<p>Considerable additional expense is involved
in the use of interiors, such as a
store, house or office building. These
have to be specially erected in the studio
and plenty of electric light used for
photographic purposes, so keep to outdoor
scenes. It can easily be done by
exercising a little ingenuity. For instance,
instead of arranging certain
action to take place inside your store, you
can get it over equally effective by arranging
for it to occur outside your
premises.</p>

<p>For economy’s sake, you need only
one copy of the positive in circulation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Page 172]</span>
Now, if you approach local motion-picture
exhibitors in the right spirit, they
may not demand a fee for showing your
advertising motion picture, as they realize
too well the value of anything with
a local appeal. You should arrange with
the leading theater to have first run of
the photoplay, say, for a week, after
which you can loan it to the next on the
waiting-list, until all have been covered.</p>

<p>Plenty of newspaper publicity is
yours, too, if you invite the local press
to be present at the producing of the
film, and also when it is about to be
released for public exhibition.</p>

		XXIX.<br>
		<small>PULLING MOVIE-SLIDE ADVERTISING OUT OF THE RUT</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>From a study of the motion-picture
screens up and down the country, I have
come to the conclusion that the average
dealer does not take the trouble to get
the fullest possible value out of his
investment.</p>

<p>The majority of the announcements
are merely plain business notices that
simply bore the spectator who has the
doubtful pleasure of sitting them
through. They do, in fact, remind one
only too strongly of the early days of
newspaper advertising, when every advertiser
thought it sufficient to have a
formal announcement, unchanged from
year in to year out. Few dealers now
would think of spending good money in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Page 174]</span>
newspaper publicity in such a hackneyed
and uninteresting fashion, because they
are well aware that their ad. has to compete
with many others, and it is only the
attractively prepared ones that command
a hearing.</p>

<p>The same methods must be applied
to movie-screen advertising, if it is to
be pulled out of the rut. There was a
period when audiences were attracted by
anything that resembled a picture. But
these days are gone and buried, and the
fans are only satisfied with a program of
the best photoplays. This being the case,
it goes without saying that they expect
the same of the efforts to hold their
attention during the reels. You can not
really expect the ad. appeals to sink in
otherwise.</p>

<p>Although you would dismiss the idea
of having a short commercial film of your
own made on the grounds of expense,
much remains to be done in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Page 175]</span>
make slide advertising interesting to picture
patrons rather than tiring them, as
it does at present. It is going to cost
you a little more money and effort, but
your slide will be distinctive and will
stand out above the rest. Your reward
will be increased results.</p>

<p>Just bear in mind, too, that you
haven’t merely got to have them look at
your slide, but arouse them to action.
This can be done by having prepared a
serial story in picture form on similar
lines to the comic supplements in the
metropolitan Sunday journals. Have a
series of slides made of it, showing one
each day until the story is told. A few
days before putting it on the screen of
the local movie show, get the operator
to throw on a rough slide to this effect:
“Watch out for the story, ‘The Good
Smith’s Meat Did for the White
Family.’” This applies to a butcher, but
a story can be written around every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Page 176]</span>
trade. There are firms who specialize in
this kind of work. This plan has been
attended with excellent results wherever
tried out.</p>

<p>If, by ingenuity, you can make the
picture on the slide move, so much the
better. A London manufacturer boosted
his bottled beer by showing the slide of
a dog drinking his master’s beer when
he was out of the room. Every time the
dog lapped up the dinner stout, the audiences
could not refrain from laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>One way by which to get on good
terms with the motion-picture exhibitor
is to offer a liberal sample of your special
line to the first hundred attending the
performance on the morrow. This allows
a direct appeal to be presented, and a
Brooklyn grocery store has made good in
drawing marked attention to their own
brand of tea.</p>

<p>Another way to make the fans laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Page 177]</span>
is to have a witty verse written alongside
an appropriate picture. I forget the actual
verse of it, but a Brooklyn hand
laundry draws the distinction between
the ape days, when clean laundry was not
necessary, and the vital importance
to-day.</p>

<p>Slide advertising puts one over the
press in securing the concentration of
readers. Surely, then, it is worth while
paying more attention to this excellent
medium.</p>

		MAINTAINING THE INTEREST IN SLIDE ADVERTISING
	</h2>
</div>

<p>It is hard to keep pace with the progress
of the motion picture. But a short
time ago the one-reel subject was considered
the maximum length; then came
the feature, requiring up to twelve reels
to tell its lengthy story. This was followed
by the photoplay series—a number
of stories linked around a set of characters,
but each complete in itself. The
movie producers, however, were not satisfied,
so they tackled the serial proper,
making a fifty-reel production and releasing
it in two-reel installments.</p>

<p>The bearing these facts have on this
article amounts to this: In motion-picture
theater publicity, and slide advertising in
particular, you have to cut the cloth according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Page 179]</span>
to the length, which, to be more
explicit, means that you must watch the
entertainment closely and follow the
general trend.</p>

<p>You, as a slide advertiser, are in
much the same position as the photoplay
producer, who is not content to rest
upon his laurels, thereby not giving the
fans an opportunity to complain. All
this has a certain physiological effect upon
picture-play-goers, who expect slides to
advance in a like manner. Now, let us
see how you can benefit by running a
series of ad. slides.</p>

<p>It will, in the first place, give you
greater confidence in entering into a contract
with the motion-picture exhibitor,
as you owe it to the spectators to complete
the series, or serial, you will begin
so auspiciously. It is good money thrown
away otherwise.</p>

<p>It is hard to maintain interest with
single slides, but with a good series, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Page 180]</span>
serial, you can actually make folks look
forward to the next slide.</p>

<p>It is essential to secure the exclusive
rights for your town. This is already
possible, for the slide manufacturers have
produced a number of excellent series in
slides. This concession, which may be
obtained by paying an additional fee, is
important, because the slides can be filled
in to suit almost any business.</p>

<p>You must, however, be prepared for
increasing your advertising revenue, but
why begrudge it when you can go one
better than other advertisers? The point
is this: Probably your exhibitor has a
dozen advertisers under contract. Not
one business is in competition. It goes
without saying that a snappy series or
serial will sink in, whereas a plain announcement
slide of another dealer will
be skimmed.</p>

<p>In a series of slides you can put over
an entertaining story, humorous in parts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Page 181]</span>
and educational in that you point out
why folks should trade with you. A
clever scenario writer-artist and skilled
slide manufacturer can do wonders for
you in this connection.</p>

<p>Equally important is arranging for
the exhibition of your slides. Most
theaters change their program daily, and
only a proportion of patrons attend regularly.
Some days the program does not
appeal to them, so they favor the rival
show. Therefore, if you were running
a slide subject of the “to be continued”
kind, you could not expect to have many
follow it from beginning to end unless
you took a system in charge.</p>

<p>Every now and then a motion-picture
producer releases a serial or series. It
is booked by the exhibitor, who arranges
for its showing at his theater in weekly
installments. The majority of his regular
patrons are present each week on the
evening set aside for the installment. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Page 182]</span>
if your slide series or serial started off
with the photoplay it would be seen in
its entirety by most folks. When you
are planning your slide series or serial,
arrange with your chosen exhibitor to
run it simultaneously with the film production.</p>

		XXXI.<br>
		<small>INDIVIDUALITY IN SLIDE ADVERTISING</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>You have heard that “imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery,” so you do
not strive to emulate the other fellow.
You prefer to go one better and raise
yourself out of the “type” clique, thus
establishing your individuality. I am
fully aware that I am treading on dangerous
ground in quoting slide advertising
as an example, for the simple
reason that it stands in a class all by
itself. How? Well, permit me to
explain.</p>

<p>Suppose you prepared a dandy advertisement,
and one entirely different from
that of your competitors. Would you
not commission your most desirable local
newspaper to insert it, with the request
that they give it as good display as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Page 184]</span>
possible. If you didn’t do this, you
would be foolish.</p>

<p>Suppose again, when next week came
round, you were hard up for a bright,
new idea, and time was precious. Rather
than go unrepresented in the next issue
you would promptly set about to prepare
a stereotyped announcement, which would
not cost you a cent more for composing.</p>

<p>Yet, if you blazoned the path of originality
in slide publicity without knowing
the correct way to go about it, the results
would be disappointing. Even
though you had prepared your copy, you
would want a humorous illustration to
back it up, and it would doubtless occur
to you to hire a local artist. Lastly, you
would put your announcement before
prospects on a home-made slide. Slide-making,
let me tell you, is an art which
has only been perfected by years of
experience.</p>

<p>If you present your screen ad. in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Page 185]</span>
crude manner, your purpose will be defeated.
So the only alternative is to
have one of the slide manufacturers
make a special slide to your order. It
should cost you about $1 additional, for
which amount you will obtain an artistic
slide.</p>

<p>Possibly it has never occurred to you
that you can use the stock slide and still
give photoplay goers the impression that
you are decidedly distinctive. The
motion-picture exhibitor believes in hiring
his screen to one advertiser in each
trade, consequently, if the slide has been
prepared specially for your trade, there
is no fear of overlapping. What I mean
is this: There are slides on the market
which, by filling in the name, address
and business, can be made applicable for
several trades. Here is one example:
“You’ll Treat Your Pocketbook Right if
You Do Your Shopping at ——.”</p>

<p>It would be rather embarrassing, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Page 186]</span>
instance, if several other traders employed
the self-same slide. The best stock
slides are those that can not be adapted
by any other trade, and there are plenty
of this kind to be had. Now, on the
other hand, there may be occasions when
a special slide is a necessity. Maybe
there are some exclusive features about
your business, to boost which slides of a
general character would be out of place.</p>

<p>The only chance a person would have
of discovering that your stock slide is
used by a competitor would be if he
happened to be a patron of more than
one motion-picture theater. Here, again,
you would gain a brilliant victory. The
fan, not being in the know, and having
seen your announcement first, would proclaim
you as the originator. And his
respect for you would naturally have a
tendency to increase.</p>

<p>So if you notice a fellow-trader using
a stock slide which takes your fancy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Page 187]</span>
don’t go and do likewise. Select something
different. Thus, you see, you can
make your slide advertisements distinctive
without incurring any additional
expense.</p>

		XXXII.<br>
		<small>THE PERSONAL ELEMENT IN SLIDE ADVERTISING</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The versatility of the stock slide ends
just where it is essential to present the
intimate appeal which counts for so
much.</p>

<p>What is that elusive something, the
personal touch? To my mind, it is by
introducing yourself to your prospects.
Now, stock slides can and do emphasize
the reasons why folks should patronize
your store, but as I take it for granted
that you desire to further convince them,
you have got to “shake hands,” in a
figurative sense.</p>

<p>Where is your store located? True
enough, you will not neglect to include
the address on the stock slide, but first
impressions are lasting. It is my intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Page 189]</span>
to advocate the adoption of what I
may term the photo-slide, for want of a
better name.</p>

<p>On your visits to the local motion-picture
theater you will have noticed that
the exhibitor is prone to using announcement
slides of forthcoming photoplays.
On this kind of slide an important scene
is reproduced from the picture and tinted
in natural colors, while the blank space
is used to good advantage with brief
description of the film.</p>

<p>These are stock slides, of course, but
if you wish to plan an advertising campaign
along similar lines, it is up to you
to have some photo-slides specially designed
to conform with your individual
requirements.</p>

<p>The best way by which to present the
personal appeal is by having a photograph
taken of the exterior of your store.
You can then forward same to a reputable
slide manufacturer, who will make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Page 190]</span>
a slide out of it in natural colors and add
the desired description.</p>

<p>The slide should have two marked
effects upon spectators. Firstly, visualize
for them exactly where your establishment
is situated, so that they may be
able to recognize it on sight, and, secondly,
it will leave a favorable impression.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
	<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Page 191]</span></p>

	<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIII">
		XXXIII.<br>
		<small>ARE YOUR SLIDES TRUTHFUL?</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>A new thing is liable to be contaminated
with the faults of its elders, but
this can not be said of motion-picture
slide advertising, which has been kept
remarkably clean and truthful.</p>

<p>It is to the credit of the slide manufacturers
that they have never accepted
any dirt-money. In other words, they
have refused to make slides for loan
sharks, whisky manufacturers, undertakers
and such like undesirable advertisers.</p>

<p>Even had this type of advertiser got
his slides made by hook or crook, he
would yet have to pass another barrier,
who had no desire to present obnoxious
announcements before his patrons.</p>

<p>Another thing, slide advertising has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Page 192]</span>
steered clear of exaggeration. I am not
absolutely sure whether it is due to the
indirect appeal or not, but I do know
that the announcements, for the greater
part, have maintained a high standard
of truthfulness.</p>

<p>Here, again, the influence may be
directly traced to the slide manufacturer,
who, when preparing a stock slide for a
jeweler, for instance, has to make it
apply equally well to jewelers throughout
the country.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, he slips a cog,
but this is not altogether his fault; the
dealer himself is partly to blame for purchasing
a slide which misrepresents his
business. It may, on the other hand, just
fit in with the individual needs of his
competitor a few blocks up the street.</p>

<p>Photoplay audiences should not be
disillusioned; the screen must be kept
free from abuses, for once spectators discover
that advertisers are in the habit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Page 193]</span>
misrepresenting the facts, they will evince
less interest in slide announcements.</p>

<p>Therefore, when purchasing a stock
slide, let the deciding factor be: “Does
it apply truthfully to my own store?” If
the answer is in the affirmative, your
slide will not strike a false note.</p>

		<small>OBTAINING THE BEST RESULTS FROM SLIDE ADVERTISING</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Not even the most successful business
man makes good in every enterprise he
undertakes. That is an impossibility,
especially in these competitive times, but,
if certain rules are observed, success can
be achieved in the majority of cases.</p>

<p>The photoplay theater is a comparatively
new advertising medium. You
may have tried it out and failed, while
your competitor, for some reason you
are unable to fathom, has won out. The
mistake too often made is to treat the
motion-picture show as a new thing—a
kind of scientific toy—but as a popular
form of amusement it has long discarded
its long pants. The photoplay, as a matter
of fact, has settled down to enjoy a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Page 195]</span>
long and flourishing career, with strict
adherence to business principles.</p>

<p>You do not find the modern exhibitor
housed in a converted store, where he
presents the crudest of films under the
most vile conditions. He would soon
find himself a bankrupt if he continued
these pioneer-day methods.</p>

<p>Maybe you have developed a similar
misunderstanding, so it is well that we
have a heart-to-heart talk.</p>

<p>It is a serious mistake to have a slide
thrown upon the screen of the least desirable
theater in your neighborhood. You
make matters a thousand times worse if
you allow it to be shown at every performance
for months, until it gets
cracked, dirty and faded, all in turn.</p>

<p>To begin with, the folks whom you
are addressing must be carefully considered.
They step inside the photoplay
theater to be entertained with attractive
films, though this is not to say that advertising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Page 196]</span>
in connection with same is
entirely out of place. Some theaters run
a performance through without a stop,
while others, mostly the nickeldromes,
introduce an intermission during the
change of each reel.</p>

<p>The former shows are continuous like
the latter, so that the one intermission is
not intended to clear the house to make
room for another audience. In reality,
it is to give the orchestra a rest and
allow time for other things, not the least
important of which is the projecting of a
batch of slides. Some of these relate to
forthcoming attractions of the theater,
and the remainder comprise advertisements
for live local traders.</p>

<p>Audiences appreciate these slides
when they do not number too many, as
they are the means of affording them
something to turn their attention to instead
of having nothing to do but idly
gaze around the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Page 197]</span></p>

<p>Motion pictures appeal to the eyes,
consequently spectators pay much more
attention to slides which contain clever
illustrations, preferably humorous, backed
up with apt sentences.</p>

<p>On the market are stock slides from
thirty-five cents and up. Space is left
for your name and address, and most
of the needs of your trade are taken care
of. New designs are constantly being
put out, which make it possible to change
slides as often as once weekly. We all
grow tired of seeing the same thing over
too many times, so if you fail to introduce
fresh pictorial announcements you
are liable to lose the respect of spectators.
Once a week is an ideal interval,
but in no case should it exceed a month.</p>

<p>There are really no standard rates
for slide advertising. Each exhibitor has
his own ideas in regard to the value of
the location and size of his theater.</p>

<p>The one great pull the photoplay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Page 198]</span>
theater has over other publicity mediums
is that you obtain one hundred per cent.
of attention, for folks, in the darkened
hall, must concentrate upon the screen.</p>

		XXXV.<br>
		<small>SELECTING THE THEATER FOR YOUR AD. SLIDE</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The other half of the battle of slide
advertising is selecting the most suitable
theater. If you are situated in a residential
section, and you decide upon a
downtown theater for your announcement,
you are paying for scattered circulation.</p>

<p>The exhibitor also rates the advertising
value of his house at a much
higher figure, and, as you draw the bulk
of your trade from the surrounding
blocks, it is advisable to pick out a local
photoplay theater.</p>

<p>Motion-picture theaters may be
grouped into two divisions. One is the
nickeldrome which has been converted
from an empty store, and seldom accompanies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Page 200]</span>
more than five hundred. It usually
shows the oldest films and caters for a
cheap patronage. This class of show is
on the decline.</p>

<p>Although the motion-picture theater
is a democratic institution, the well-to-do
working classes prefer to patronize the
classy building which has been exclusively
erected for motion-picture entertainments.
It is not because they refuse to
associate with their poor brothers and
sisters; quality is the deciding factor.
For five or ten cents more they see a
longer and better program, amid more
comfortable surroundings.</p>

<p>So far, so good; the rest depends on
the managerial policy. The best way to
discover this is to visit a desirable theater
as an ordinary patron. If you note your
trade is already represented on the
screen, then the theater is unavailable
for the time being.</p>

<p>This may strike you as peculiar, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Page 201]</span>
no newspaper grants a monopoly in one
particular trade, but it is the custom in
slide advertising. The healthiness of a
newspaper may be judged by the volume
of advertising it carries, but, in so far as
the photoplay is concerned, the fewer the
slides the better. Time is precious, and,
if the exhibitor is to give each advertiser
the service he pays for, he can only
do so when the slides do not exceed one
dozen. When the number is more, the
operator usually whips each off before
spectators are able to read it.</p>

<p>After you have satisfied yourself on
all these things, you can take the matter
up with the exhibitor. You may frown
upon a six months’ contract, but the
rental, which will vary from $5 to $10
per month, according to size and location
of theater, will work out more cheaply
than on the weekly basis. It will also
afford you protection in that your competitor
can not put one over. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Page 202]</span>
thing, the public may only give your
first slides the once over, but the constant
seeing of your name will go right home.</p>

<p>The slide manufacturers find that
there is so much correspondence involved
in executing orders of less than one
dollar that they prefer they be given to
the exhibitor, who orders slides in
quantities.</p>

		<small>HANDLING THE ANTI-AD. SLIDE EXHIBITOR</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Have you ever had legitimate advertising
turned down by a newspaper? I
don’t suppose this rare experience has
fallen to your lot, so it is perhaps as
well if I acquaint you with the conditions
that exist in the motion-picture theater
advertising field.</p>

<p>The motion picture has not reached
maturity, and consequently some branches
of the industry are not so far advanced
as others. In the former category comes
slide advertising.</p>

<p>There are some exhibitors who throw
up their hands at the very mention of
slide advertising, yet the strange part
about it is that they themselves can not
get along without this excellent form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Page 204]</span>
publicity. They run a bunch of slides on
the screen pertaining to current attractions
and house announcements. These
occupy the screen for five minutes or
more, and are repeated at every performance
for fully one week.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to advertise productions
so far in advance, and this
would allow “foreign” advertising to
have a look in, but this type of exhibitor
generally refuses to listen to reason.
And the worse still is the fact that he
knows he has the upper hand of you.</p>

<p>Let me assume that you are located
in a neighborhood section, which is
catered for by one photoplay theater.
There may be another in the next section,
but, however desirable this theater,
it will not produce so much business, for
it is a trait of Americans not to walk
further than is necessary.</p>

<p>If the exhibitor on your block favors
slide advertising, the rest is easy, but if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Page 205]</span>
he is opposed to it, it is up to you to
assume a resourceful attitude.</p>

<p>The chances are that this exhibitor
issues a house organ of some sort, for
which he is prepared to accept advertising
from desirable local stores. Here,
then, is your opportunity. If you have
ever glanced over a slide catalogue, you
will agree with me that slides, when
reproduced in black and white, make
dandy press advertisements.</p>

<p>Many dealers who believe in attractive
slide announcements undo all their
good work by following same up by
stereotyped ads. in the theater house
organ. It is, of course, a great advantage
to have the former already prepared
by expert advertising men, so the stock
slide in the latter capacity would seem
to leave little to be desired.</p>

<p>Contract for, say, three inches of
space weekly, with weekly change of
copy, for which purpose a suitable stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Page 206]</span>
slide should be selected. Your slide
manufacturer will willingly grant you
permission to have cuts made of his
slides and reproduce them, if you give
him the credit. Your ad. will stand
out prominently from the rest, and readers
will admire its all-round excellence.</p>

<p>The question now arises as to what
use you are to make of the slide. If
there is another theater within easy walking
distance, it would do no harm to
arrange for a weekly change of slides.
Between the two, you should hit the
mark.</p>

		<small>HAVING YOUR MOVIE AD. SLIDES SHOWN TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Watching motion-picture screens is
my hobby, and, incidentally, my business.
Four times a week do I combine business
with pleasure, and it is these on-the-spot
investigations that have given me
good grounds for asserting that the
average exhibitor does not appreciate the
fact that there is an art in showing your
slides to the best possible advantage. He
seems to imagine that they can be thrown
in any slipshod way, so long as he can
claim to have shown them according to
arrangement.</p>

<p>He does not realize that he is under
an obligation to you, represented on his
theater screen by paid advertising. Were
the local paper you favor to print your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Page 208]</span>
ad. full of typographical errors and badly
blend the type faces, or place your ad.
in the most inconspicuous portion of the
paper, you would, naturally, be offended
and be likely to transfer your advertising
account to the rival publication. This
is why I advise you and your friends to
frequent the theater that carries your
advertising and see if you are getting
value for your money.</p>

<p>At a certain motion-picture theater
in Brooklyn about thirty slides are shown
at the end of every performance. You
have only got to look at the faces of the
spectators to realize the resentment
caused by the bad practice. That number
of slides at one time is entirely too many.
The exhibitor of this type is attempting
to cram the stuff down the necks of his
patrons, whereas he should accomplish it
in an unforced manner. The latter is
easily gotten over by showing only several
slides at the end of each reel. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Page 209]</span>
are thus spread out and have a far
greater chance of sinking in, because
picture-play-goers are not called upon to
memorize a lot at one gulp, so to speak.
In this way the patience of patrons is not
overtaxed. The exhibitor can never tell,
when he puts over his all-at-a-time slide
stunt, whether or not he is sending spectators
away to his competitor a few blocks
up the street. I have personally known
exhibitors who have been unable to account
for the falling off of attendance,
yet the whole root of the trouble was
the slide dodge.</p>

<p>It is typically American to shirk telling
openly anything that displeases, so
that offended patron says nothing and is
never seen inside the theater again. This
rebounds on you, for these offended folks
become your mortal enemy and lay the
blame on the ads. themselves.</p>

<p>Even at those halls that follow the
commendable methods outlined, spectators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Page 210]</span>
often see the entire performance through
without witnessing all the slides. The
mistake made by the exhibitor in this
case is to project one of his own slides
first to tell what the next photoplay will
be. This serves to reveal to patrons that
they have seen the reels over once, so
they rise and leave the show right then.
Instead, why not tell your exhibitor to
hold back this condemning slide until
the last, in order to have the audience sit
out the others? Besides, the one advantage
of this form of advertising is that
there is no competition in commanding
attention simultaneously. Each slide is
projected separately, and it is advisable,
if only for the reason stated, to run only
a few at a time instead of the whole
bunch.</p>

<p>As the provider of this extra revenue
for the movie showman, it is up to you to
see adequate treatment for your investment.</p>

		XXXVIII.<br>
		<small>THE IDEAL SLIDE FOLLOW-UP MEDIUM</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>To obtain the greatest possible results
from slide advertising, there must be an
effective follow-up scheme. You may
have gotten the hunch that as you change
your slide frequently it is quite sufficient.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, only half of the
battle is won, for the slide is not sufficiently
elastic to perform everything demanded
of it. At the motion-picture
theater your slide is probably one of a
dozen, and it is well-nigh impossible for
a spectator to retain a vivid recollection
of them all. You have got to remind
him, and, incidentally, present the direct
appeal. That means your advertisement
being presented in a permanent form. It
may occur to you at first to use the
columns of the best local newspaper, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Page 212]</span>
while this has its good points, it falls
short of the type of follow-up medium
needed for slide publicity.</p>

<p>A newspaper, as a rule, covers the
town like a blanket, but the neighborhood
photoplay theater draws the majority of
its patrons from the surrounding blocks.
So, if you wish to obtain 100 per cent.
value from your investment, it is up to
you to employ the house organ gotten
out by the exhibitor. This publication
gets into the hands of all patrons of the
theater regularly every week, and the
fans study it from cover to cover when
they reach home.</p>

<p>The grave mistake some dealers make
at this stage is to forsake the slide for
the house organ. It may be an economical
plan on the surface, but, believe me,
it is penny wise and pound foolish in the
long run.</p>

<p>The slide serves to get acquainted
with your prospects, who can not possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Page 213]</span>
ignore it in the darkened hall, so you
secure their attention, while the printed
page might escape their notice.</p>

<p>I have frequently remarked upon the
attractiveness of the stock slide, and this
time I am going to contrast it with the
stereotyped business card.</p>

<p>This is a snappy slide recently used
by a Brooklyn dyer and cleaner: “Don’t
Get ‘Held Up’ for Inferior Cleaning and
Pressing. Try Us for Expert Work at
Fair Prices.” In the left-hand corner
was a sketch of a New York tough pointing
his revolver at a terrified meek man.</p>

<p>The follow-up advertisement in the
theater house organ was as follows:
“Suits Pressed, 25c. Sponged and
Pressed, 35c. Cleaned and Sponged, 50c.
Dry Cleaned, $1.00. Pants Sponged and
Pressed, 10c. Also Ladies’ Work.”</p>

<p>It was as easy as kiss your hand to
be entertaining in the first instance, because
the slide was one of the stock kind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Page 214]</span>
This fact, however, does not excuse the
advertiser from putting some real
thought behind his announcements, for,
otherwise, the interest of the reader
fizzles like a damp firework.</p>

		<small>ATTRACTING FARMERS TO TOWN</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>If you are a country town merchant,
you are at the mercy of the weather, and
trade suffers accordingly. The farmer is
a good customer, and you must offer
some inducement if he is to be persuaded
to make his customary trip to town when
the weather is bad.</p>

<p>Practically everybody likes motion
pictures, and the farmer is probably as
keen a fan as his city cousin, only circumstances
preventing him from attending so
often.</p>

<p>I know of a merchant down in Harrisonville,
Missouri, who got wise to the
fact and presented his farm customers
with free motion-picture theater tickets.
He now finds that the weather makes not
a particle of difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Page 216]</span></p>

<p>How, then, can you make certain of
doing good business every Saturday, rain
or shine? I would suggest that you try
out the self-same stunt.</p>

<p>In the first place, the local motion-picture
exhibitor, being a business man, is
always on the warpath for opportunities
for increasing his patronage, so, if you
approached him on the subject of selling
admission tickets at a reduced price, he
would undoubtedly come to terms with
you.</p>

<p>It might be well that you ask him to
put on mostly rural pictures. This may
seem like carrying coal to Newcastle, but
it has been proven that rural folks much
prefer farming subjects.</p>

<p>This settled, mail two complimentary
tickets, with a letter about the character
of the program, to your farmer customers
sufficiently in advance to be used, and
mark them good for only the Saturday
matinees.</p>

		<small>CAPITALIZING POPULAR SCREEN PLAYERS IN SLIDE ADVERTISING</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The national advertiser often links up
his products with that of a popular photoplayer
by christening a branded article
after the actor. Failing this, he secures
a testimonial, for which privilege he pays
handsomely. The reason is obvious, for
the stars are worshiped by countless
thousands all over the country, in smallest
village and largest city, and, naturally,
the use of a name means a big boost
for the article advertised. You see, the
fans do not see their idols in the flesh,
which causes them to evince unusual
interest in anything to which the player’s
name is attached.</p>

<p>Perhaps motion-picture audiences
have been spoilt through the ever-changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Page 218]</span>
flow of new productions, as this
demand for something new has had a
marked effect upon slide advertising. The
dealer never hesitates to try out something
original.</p>

<p>The value of an article linked up with
a photoplayer increases a thousand-fold
when advertised in the photoplay theater,
and consequently the slide on which mention
is made of a screen favorite will
attract more attention than the slides
you are at present using.</p>

<p>I am not going to suggest that you
apply to the fountain-head, so that you
may follow in the footsteps of the national
advertiser. In the first place, it is out
of the question, for the photoplayer, unlike
his legitimate brother, does not
travel from town to town. Now and
then, it is true, he does tour certain
motion-picture theaters, but these occasions
are not sufficiently frequent for you
to wait for one to occur in your town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Page 219]</span></p>

<p>I have a method in mind which will
cost you nothing additional outside of the
slide. This is just a rough draft of the
wording:</p>

<p>“We Know of a Girl Who Tried to
Manufacture Dimples Because She Envied
Lillian Walker’s.</p>

<p>“As Miss Walker is Famous for Her
Dimples, so Are We for Our Candy.”</p>

<p>At the side of the slide you should
have your slide manufacturer reproduce
a photograph of this popular Vitagraph
player.</p>

<p>This item about Miss Walker, you
will note, implies no recommendation
from her, so the same can not possibly
be misconstrued. Here follows the original
paragraph, as submitted by Lillian
Walker’s press agent: “Don’t you dare
attempt to manufacture dimples; they
are a monopolized product, and Lillian
Walker has the motion-picture field all to
herself. The other day the popular Vitagraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Page 220]</span>
player received a letter from a
girl admirer, who, desiring a beauty dent
on each cheek, endured great pain, but
all to no avail.”</p>

<p>The press agents in the motion-picture
field are so prolific that seldom a
week goes by without one appearing
which may be adapted to your business.</p>

<p>If you adopt the photoplayer slide, it
is imperative for you to change the slide
frequently, not only because spectators
dislike to see the same thing over again,
but because each fan has his or her
favorite, and by constantly changing the
players you eventually cover them all,
and thus please each and every patron.</p>

<p>If your local newspaper runs a motion-picture
department, study it thoroughly
for possible material. If it does
not, one of the many motion-picture
publications will admirably serve the purpose.
As the items are news, there is no
copyright.</p>

		<small>ATTRACTING TRADE WITH PHOTOPLAY STARS</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Both the legitimate and vaudeville
professions have their followings, but
neither can even slightly approach the
huge and widespread popularity enjoyed
by the motion picture. A conservative
estimate places the number of fans in
this country at twenty millions, which
number support the twenty thousand
photoplay theaters.</p>

<p>The personal element counts big in
this industry, and the leading photoplayers
come foremost in the affections
of the fans. There are more than two
hundred well-known motion-picture players
appearing before the camera to-day,
and each movie patron has his or her
favorite. And this is just where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Page 222]</span>
enterprising storekeeper can pounce upon
this opportunity for all it is worth, which
is a good deal.</p>

<p>If in view of what has gone before,
you are still skeptical that an amusement
can not be mixed with publicity, I have
only to cite the method adopted by a
trader in Los Angeles. He gave over
his window display to photographs of
famous film players and arranged them
in an artistic manner. His window happened
to face the sidewalk, and the pictures
created so much attention that the
sidewalk was congested. Two policemen,
to cope with the situation, had to have
the crowd line up and only allow each
spectator three minutes in which to view
the photographs. All day long the line
extended over a block, the windows
arousing the same amount of interest
during the subsequent days of the exhibition.</p>

<p>It might hardly be a sound business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Page 223]</span>
policy to display only photographs in
your store window to the total exclusion
of your ordinary wares, for the underlying
idea to get passers-by to view the
goods set out in the window and act as
a sort of temptation to buy. I would
therefore propose that the photographs
be mounted on boards at the back of your
window, so as to allow the window to
be dressed in the ordinary way. This
should achieve the desired object satisfactorily.</p>

<p>You will find, on approaching the
motion-picture producing companies, that
they will only be too willing to give or
loan you photographs of their stock players.
The local exhibitor will supply their
addresses.</p>

<p>Another dandy plan, if you are in the
custom of offering premiums, is to present
each person making a purchase of
a certain small amount with a post-card
of a popular screen player. You can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Page 224]</span>
purchase these for $3 per thousand and
have the selection you prefer, for you
will naturally require more of Mary
Pickford and Charles Chaplin than players
of lesser renown.</p>

<p>I am not acquainted with any instances
where retailers have adopted the preceding
plan, but if same can bring full
houses on dull nights to motion-picture
theaters that distribute such pictures to
spectators, then it is a positive thing that
it will help along your slack days.</p>

<p>Popularity contests are all in the
fashion to-day, and it is possible for
every town to arouse the patriotism of
the fans by permitting them to vote for
their favorite player, presenting, perhaps,
the one heading the poll with a
suitable souvenir on behalf of the town.
This stunt, of course, must be worked
in co-operation with the near-by motion-picture
theater.</p>

<p>It can be arranged that each patron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Page 225]</span>
on entering receives a voting blank,
which he is to fill up and return to the
girl in the pay-box. The exhibitor should
announce on a slide that the standing of
the contestants will be announced each
day in the window of your store.</p>

<p>You will secure, for practically no
expense at all, plenty of publicity, resulting
in increased business.</p>

		<small>TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ERRORS IN PHOTOPLAYS</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Every now and then a motion-picture
producer comes a cropper. With the
speeded-up production methods at present
prevailing, he can seldom give adequate
attention to the little things that
count. It matters little whether the play
is historical or modern—it is almost certain
to contain at least one error of some
kind. Now, photoplay fans pride themselves
upon their smartness in detecting
these silly slips, and therefore an added
stimulant would please them greatly.</p>

<p>In addition to your ordinary slide at
the local movie theater, why not have
same preceded with one worded somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p>“If You Find a Mistake Pertaining to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Page 227]</span>
the Dry-goods Business in a Photoplay
Screened at This Theater, We Will Present
You with 25 Cents’ Worth of Goods
Free”?</p>

<p>The first thing is to determine as to
what constitutes an error. In one photoplay
a daughter ran away from home and
returned to the family fold five years
later with the same dress on her back.</p>

<p>Almost as bad was another picture in
which the chief character, an old gardener,
began his day’s work with an old
overall. At the end of the day he blossomed
forth in a new garment.</p>

<p>Mistakes are quite as prevalent in
Western dramas. Imagine, then, as I
did, seeing an Indian girl wearing silk
hosiery.</p>

<p>There are much worse mistakes in
historical films. You will remember that
“Jane Eyre,” Charlotte Bronte’s famous
novel, was set in the early part of the
nineteenth century, but the heroine in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Page 228]</span>
photoplay version was up to the minute
in fashions.</p>

<p>It is quite likely that more than one
spectator will detect the same error, in
which case it will prove too costly a
stunt, so it is advisable to limit same to
the first four persons who report the
error. As the average motion-picture
theater changes its program daily, it will
be hard to verify the mistakes, which
may not prove to be such. To guard
yourself against the unscrupulous, it is
well for you or somebody you can trust
to see each program. Failing this, stipulate
that spectators report the error to
the exhibitor immediately after seeing the
picture.</p>

<p>This stunt, besides drawing additional
attention to your regular slide, should
result in permanent customers. Moreover,
those folk who delve beneath the
surface will realize that were not your
goods satisfactory you would, instead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Page 229]</span>
offer a quarter in cash. Do not neglect
to have the names and addresses of the
winners, together with particulars of
their errors, screened, for it will assuredly
prove an incentive to the unlucky
ones.</p>

		<small>HOW THE BOOK DEALER CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MOVIE ADAPTATION MANIA</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The saloon-keeper may attribute decreased
business to the versatile motion
picture, but to the average book dealer
the industry can be most beneficial.</p>

<p>It is what might be called the adaptation
mania from which both publishers
and book dealers have profited. To prove
this, you have only to take into account
“Les Miserables,” which, when released
at the picture theaters, created an enormous
sale of cheap reprints of the
popular book.</p>

<p>This has been followed up by many
other adaptations from novels and stage
plays, and in every case it has meant
extra trade for the book dealer who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Page 231]</span>
been keen enough to make good use of
the opportunities thus presented. Many
movie fans, after seeing the photoplay
version of a popular book, and finding it
to their liking, have a desire for reading
the story. Instead of borrowing the book
from the local library, they prefer to
spend up to a quarter on a cheap edition—and
this is precisely where the book
trade comes in.</p>

<p>Hardly a week goes by without some
popular book or play has been produced
in motion-picture form.</p>

<p>There are apparently few book dealers
who have given this new field of business
activity the close attention it demands.
Some have been content to wait
until the demand came—a most short-sighted
policy that meant customers going
elsewhere—whilst others have sat down
and let the exhibitor reap the harvest.</p>

<p>I think it worth while for every book
dealer to make a friend of the local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Page 232]</span>
motion-picture showman. The benefit
would be mutual. The exhibitor could
inform the book dealer well in advance
whether he had any adaptations booked,
so that the book dealer could lay in a
stock to meet the demand. He could
also announce outside his store that the
picture was being shown at the theater
in question, whilst all could obtain the
book of the film from him.</p>

<p>The exhibitor would reciprocate the
publicity thus given by announcing that
the book was obtainable of the book
dealer, or by allowing the latter to distribute
circulars to the audience.</p>

<p>These are but suggestions. Other
possible schemes may be devised by the
wide-awake book dealer. It is, however,
well to know that here is a source of
revenue to be tapped.</p>

		<small>SELLING REAL ESTATE BY THE FILM</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The real-estate agent operating from
a distance in selling vacant lots and
houses is placed at a considerable disadvantage.</p>

<p>When a prospective purchaser comes
along the chances are in nine cases out
of ten that he has been so misled by
some other members of the fraternity
that all the arguments in the world will
not convince him that a certain piece of
property on your books is just the very
thing he is seeking.</p>

<p>When you invite him to pay an
inspection, he will probably say: “I’m not
going on a wild-goose chase, so I want
some tangible evidence that it is likely
to suit me.”</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about it is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Page 234]</span>
the innocent have to pay for the sins of
the guilty, and the only effective way
you can convince such an individual is
by a motion picture.</p>

<p>Then, on the other hand, there is the
client whose time is limited and may not
be able to make the trip on chance.</p>

<p>The motion picture is next to the
actual thing, for it shows everything as
in real life without any tendency to exaggerate
or allow false claims to enter. It
can not be thought, however, that the
deal can be clinched without the personal
visit. The film serves to pave the way
for this.</p>

<p>This is not mere theory conjured up
from the vision of an armchair. The
credit for putting the plan into actual
operation is due to Western enterprise.
I refer to the Newell Murdoch Company,
who own the San Francisco suburb of
Forest Hill.</p>

<p>Bearing the title of “A Drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Page 235]</span>
Through Forest Hill,” the film opened by
showing the grand stairway at the main
entrance, with the tract office in the
offing. Then came a number of panoramic
views, introducing the spectator to
the serpentine turnpikes, streets and
avenues. Finished houses were revealed,
as well as those in a partial stage of
construction. A tract salesman is also
shown meeting automobile parties of
prospective purchasers. This film was
presented for public exhibition in the
ordinary way at twenty of the downtown
theaters, where it created much interest
and ultimately produced some more
buyers.</p>

<p>It might also be well to show the
interiors, for the inside of a house is
even more important than its exterior
aspects. This was formerly impossible,
owing to the adverse photographic conditions
and the difficulty and expense in
installing adequate artificial lighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Page 236]</span>
equipment. Lately, however, an invention
has rendered it both possible and
practicable.</p>

<p>Additional interest would be lent to
the motion picture by introducing residents
in typical poses, recreations, and so
forth. This would enable the prospective
resident to gain some idea of what
his neighbors would be like. Another
convincing touch would be added if the
transportation facilities could be introduced.</p>

<p>Romance figures in practically every
photoplay. Of all the themes, domestic
troubles form the most prolific one for
the scenario writer. It stands to reason,
therefore, that motion-picture audiences
would better appreciate a comedy. There
is abundant material for introducing the
advertising element, such as a newly married
couple who finds paradise on your
estate, or a family who experiences a
great difficulty in securing the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Page 237]</span>
house, and yours measures up highly to
their exacting wants. These are but
suggestions to indicate just what lines
you should pursue. A story can be easily
woven around your estate, introducing
characteristic scenes in a perfectly natural
manner.</p>

<p>The local theaters will be more than
glad to have your film, if it conforms to
the usual run of photoplay stories, and
you may get them to show it for nothing
instead of for a fee.</p>

<p>Maybe you would not care to go to
the expense and trouble of fitting up a
room in your office as a private theater
and installing special motion-picture apparatus,
so would suggest that you make
arrangements beforehand with the nearest
movie exhibitor for the hire of his
hall and operator when not engaged.
You can then show your dubious prospect
at any time convenient to him.</p>

		<small>ADVERTISING YOUR DEPARTMENT STORE BY MOTION PICTURES</small>

<p>Department stores, whether large or
small, in search of new ways and means
of attracting the public in face of competition,
will find in the versatile motion
picture a publicity medium which fully
comes up to their requirements. Having
the novelty element, it is bound to create
unusual attention, resulting ultimately in
increased business.</p>

<p>The idea, however, is not new to
England, for the well-known London
department store of Selfridge’s, owned
by the American of that name, had a
one-reel film produced some time ago.
This showed how customers and staff
are treated by the firm, dealing with
accidents and illness, and keeping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Page 239]</span>
employees fit by physical-culture drills
on the roof garden.</p>

<p>The picture, besides capturing the
fancy of the public at a cinematograph
exposition held in London, was also put
on at the principal theaters throughout
London and suburbs.</p>

<p>To acquaint the public with how their
welfare is studied and that of the employees
is just the very thing to form
the basis of a successful film. It is, on
the other hand, hardly practicable to
extend the advertising to specific bargain
offers, such as you often set forth in
newspaper announcements. The boiled-down
stories of every-day life, which are
so frequently seen on the movie screen
and are so popular with the majority of
picture-play-goers, offer their counterpart
in the advertising field, so department
stores would be wise to follow the
fashion.</p>

<p>Such a photoplay would stir more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Page 240]</span>
interest than an ordinary industrial, and
it is safe to say that your points would
get home better. Audiences would be
delighted in recognizing it as a home
product, set amid familiar scenes in the
neighborhood. It might also be advisable
to introduce well-known local players in
the cast.</p>

<p>There is abundant scope for a trained
scenario writer to block out an interesting
story. You can have, for instance, Mrs.
Brown, all tired out and discontented
after a tour of all the shops except yours.
She happens to meet Mrs. Smith, her
friend, on her way home. Mrs. Smith
is the picture of content, through trading
at your store, and, after sympathizing
with Mrs. Brown, invites her to try your
store. She takes the tip and is too
pleased for words.</p>

<p>This is just a rough outline so as to
give you an idea of what can be done.</p>

<p>You could also have the story written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Page 241]</span>
up in fiction form and insert it in the
columns of the newspaper you favor,
announcing at the bottom where and
when the film version is being presented.
The exhibitors of the theaters in question
will be more inclined to entertain
your proposition and accept a smaller fee
if they know they are going to obtain
some additional advertising.</p>

<p>As much discretion in selecting
motion-picture theaters must be used as
if you were selecting reliable press mediums.
You will find that the downtown
theaters attract the workers of both
sexes in the lunch hours, and in the
afternoons the audiences, for the most
part, comprise ladies seeking relaxation
after shopping tours.</p>

<p>But out in the suburbs and residential
districts business men and their wives go
to the shows in the evening after supper
to drive away the worries and irritations
of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Page 242]</span></p>

<p>If yours is a high-class store, it naturally
will not do to have your film shown
at a nickeldrome attracting the poorest
of the working classes. I would especially
advise you, before putting your motion
picture into circulation, to make a tour
of the photoplay theaters in your territory.
It is not enough to judge by the
outside appearance—mingle with the
audience—and size each one up from the
point of view of your proposition.</p>

		XLVI.<br>
		<small>HITCHING MOTION PICTURES TO MUSICAL ADVERTISING</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The versatility of the motion picture
is not confined to the varied entertainment
offered. Both the films and theaters
can be linked together and be converted
into business producers for the musical
trade.</p>

<p>Should I be accused of presenting
mere theories, then I would respectfully
call your attention to the fact that what
I am about to suggest is based upon
actual successful cases of the movies
being employed as an advertising
medium.</p>

<p>Some time back the Edison Company
started to issue musical selections for
motion-picture orchestras, so that their
photoplays could be played to as appropriately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Page 244]</span>
as possible. When one realizes
that the majority of the shows change
their program every day, it can be seen
that there does not exist much time beforehand
to prepare suitable musical
pieces. It may scarcely be needed to
add that the exhibitors appreciate this
co-operation on the part of the film
producer.</p>

<p>This example has since been followed
by the Universal Film Company. They
devote almost a whole page in their house
organ to the correct music to accompany
their motion pictures with.</p>

<p>The field is a good one for plucking,
for there are twenty thousand motion-picture
theaters from Maine to California,
and the average show puts on six
fresh reels every day. The average number
of selections for each reel is three,
brought about by the quick-changing
situations presented.</p>

<p>The method of one song publisher by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Page 245]</span>
which to popularize his wares to the folks
in front is to arrange with a number of
neighborhood theaters to take on a singing
act between the reels. The singer
has the assistance of the band, and the
audience is encouraged to join in the
swinging chorus by a slide thrown upon
the screen containing the words. At the
top of this is a notice stating that the So
and So Company publishes no bad songs.</p>

<p>To hark back, on the musical page
of one of the house organs is a notice to
the effect that if the orchestra leaders do
not happen to possess the music, they can
obtain it from certain concerns in New
York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I am quite in the dark as to the actual
inside arrangements which have been
come to, but I presume that this is a sort
of co-operative plan, whereby, in return
for reviewing the company’s productions
from the musical point of view, this
publicity is provided in return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Page 246]</span></p>

<p>Inasmuch as only two of the thirty
or more motion-picture producers are
helping the exhibitor in this manner, it
would seem that there exists a particularly
good opportunity to endeavor to
coax the others to follow suit.</p>

<p>Movie fans are mostly home-loving
folks, and are at all times on the warpath
for new songs to play at home. This is
proved by the fact that it is nothing
unusual for an exhibitor to receive an
inquiry from a patron asking for particulars
of a certain piece of music that
has taken his or her fancy.</p>

<p>Some songs lend themselves particularly
well to motion-picture production,
and such popular ones as “It’s a Long,
Long Way to Tipperary” and “Home,
Sweet Home,” have already been filmed,
thus further helping to popularize them.
The ideal song as a photoplay is one
which offers abundant scope for action
and is also true to life. Most film versions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Page 247]</span>
thus far have been prepared after
the song has achieved considerable fame.
If, however, the publisher is to reap the
full benefit, the movie picturization
should be released simultaneously with
the publication of the song.</p>

		XLVII.<br>
		<small>DEVELOPING “HAVE A GARDEN” MOVEMENT WITH PHOTOPLAY THEATER HELP</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The spring and summer are the busy
seasons for the nurseryman and florist,
for the thoughts of the city folk fly in
the direction of the open air. The garden
being the first haven of refuge, the
garden “outfitter,” if I may be permitted
to coin a term, benefits financially.</p>

<p>The neighborhood theater is best
suited to your purpose, as the majority
of the patrons are located in residential
sections. You approach them in the right
mood, for one of the charms of the
motion picture, as you are doubtless
aware, is the natural backgrounds. Although
a fair sprinkling of the stories
are set in the city, there are a goodly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Page 249]</span>
number located in rural communities,
consequently spectators see lovely gardens,
farms, ranches, to say nothing of
the handiwork of nature represented by
the prairies and forests. All this makes
the city dweller feel as though he would
like to get away from his artificial surroundings,
so he unconsciously thinks
about converting his back and front lots
into gardens and have his window-sills
filled with plants.</p>

<p>He may have just gotten to that
wavering point where it needs an incentive
to stir him to action, for he is apt to
forget his cherished hopes when plunged
in business on the following day.</p>

<p>It is customary, at some motion-picture
theaters, to present premiums on a
certain night each week. Each patron on
entering is given a numbered ticket, and
at an appointed hour about four numbers
are drawn, the lucky ones being presented
with a useful article. The exhibitor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Page 250]</span>
in most instances, has neglected to
enlist local co-operation and has purchased
his premiums at wholesale price
from headquarters. It may be because it
is hardly profitable to local traders, since
only four out of a possible thousand
would feel kindly disposed toward them.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who recently returned
from a tour down South informs
me that he discovered a plan in his
travels which has overcome this apparent
difficulty. It appears that each lady paying
for admission to the Columbus Theater
at Mount Allen on a certain Wednesday
night was presented with a ticket
good for either a fifty-cent rosebush or
else a plum or peach tree at the local
nurseryman’s.</p>

<p>Each woman duly presented herself at
the nursery and was permitted to select
her own plant. This afforded the florist
an opportunity to introduce many others
of his line, and there were very few who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Page 251]</span>
did not spend from $1 to $10 with him.</p>

<p>The only criticism I have to offer is
that the proposition might have been
extended to the men, as there were undoubtedly
married men in the audience,
unaccompanied by their wives, as well as
single ones who would care to take up
gardening as a hobby.</p>

<p>The nurseryman in this case charged
the exhibitor the absolute rock-bottom
price for each plant, relying upon the
extra permanent business secured to
compensate for the sacrifice made.</p>

		XLVIII.<br>
		<small>NAMING SODA-FOUNTAIN CONCOCTIONS AFTER MOVIES</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Druggists should not be backward in
availing themselves of one of the strongest
forces of modern times—the motion
picture. It is a poor town that does not
contain a photoplay theater, and in most
towns they are as plentiful as druggists—one
on every few blocks.</p>

<p>The proportion of motion-picture
goers in this country is one to every five
inhabitants, and, however it may work
out in your town, it is practically certain
that the majority of men, women and
children spend their evenings at the
motion-picture show. After they have
seen the performance through, they are
in the right mood to pay a visit to a soda
fountain. Do you make any inducements
to attract their patronage? Maybe you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Page 253]</span>
don’t, so let me suggest how you can
accomplish this.</p>

<p>Why not introduce a Lillian Walker
sundae, an Edward Earle frappe and a
Charlie Chaplin soda? The name goes
a long way, but if you can make the concoction
distinctive it is an added advantage.
Lillian Walker, for instance, is
famed far and wide for her dimples,
which are not without their publicity
possibilities.</p>

<p>Do not adhere to any one particular
player for too long a period, for each fan
has his or her favorite, and if you make,
say, a daily change, you eventually cover
them all.</p>

<p>Obviously, the most effective advertising
medium is the motion-picture theater.
If the exhibitor rents out his screen
to retailers, you should arrange to have a
slide shown. Failing this, an advertisement
in the house organ or program
should produce the desired results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Page 254]</span></p>

<p>In regard to the well-known brands
of photoplays, I know of a pharmacist in
Beatrice, Nebraska, who invented the
Triangle sundae. This comprised a mixture
of vanilla and dark chocolate ice-cream,
over which was placed a confection
triangle, the work of a local baker.
On the top of this were three cherries
and three green candied plums. This
stunt was pulled off in co-operation with
a local photoplay exhibitor, who was as
satisfied with the extra business secured
as was the druggist.</p>

<p>Triangle is only one brand of popular
photoplays with advertising possibilities.
Others are Paramount, Red Feather,
Blue Bird, Metro, World, Mutual, Universal,
Gold Rooster, Beauty, Biograph,
Kalem, Vitagraph, Edison, Essanay,
Selig, Lubin and Thanhouser.</p>

<p>It may be argued that it is giving the
manufacturer free publicity, but it does
not sell him any more prints, for the exhibitor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Page 255]</span>
as a rule, contracts for all the
productions released under a certain banner.
You would, of course, benefit the
manufacturer were you to boost brands
indiscriminately, but the success of the
stunt depends on securing the assistance
of the local exhibitor. When that is
secured, you only christen soda-fountain
concoctions after the brands of photoplays
to be seen at his theater. A little
extra time and effort in devising new
soda-fountain lines will be well repaid.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
